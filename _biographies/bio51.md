bio_text: "<p>Peter Paul Rubens was born in Siegen, Germany in 1577 to Jan Rubens,
  a Protestant lawyer and alderman, and Maria Pijpelinckx. In 1568 while serving as
  her secretary, Jan had an adulterous affair with Anna of Saxony, Princess of Orange.
  The family was exiled from Antwerp to Westphalia where Peter Paul was born roughly
  a decade later. At the age of twelve, after the death of his father, Rubens and
  his family moved the family back to Antwerp, the city that would foster his enormous
  individual fame and his success as a collaborator of Jan Brueghel.</p><p>Once in
  Antwerp, Rubens was enrolled in the prestigious Latin school of Rombout Verdonck
  and by age thirteen became the court page in the household of Countess Marguerite
  de Lalaing d’Arenburg. Both Classics and court society would become recurring motifs
  throughout his life; in his adulthood Rubens was fluent in six languages, collected
  ancient gems and other objects, and had Classical texts read aloud to him as he
  worked. His early introduction to Classical education and the social nuances of
  the elite class afforded him flexibility and freedom in his relationships with patrons
  who entrusted him with artistic and diplomatic commissions alike.</p><p>Young Rubens
  quickly grew bored with the court routine and began an apprenticeship with the landscape
  painter Tobias Verhaecht. In 1594, after a further apprenticeship with history painter
  Adam van Noort, he went to work under Otto van Veen, a distinguished artist and
  intellectual who directed a large studio in Antwerp. Rubens may have worked with
  Van Veen until his departure for Italy. All the while, the voracious young Rubens
  pursued his own artistic self- training; he copied the early prints of German masters,
  attempting to broaden his visual lexicon. He became a master in the Guild of Saint
  Luke in 1598 just one year after Jan Brueghel was admitted into the Guild as a “master’s
  son.” This artists’ society was likely the initial point of contact for Rubens and
  Brueghel who completed their first collaboration, The Battle of the Amazons, in
  1599 (Potsdam). </p><p>Shortly after the completion of this inaugural collaboration,
  in 1600, Rubens left for Italy. His first stop was Venice, where he studied the
  works of Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto; then he came to Mantua, his most settled
  home during his eight year Italian sojourn. In Mantua he worked at both painting
  and duplicating portraits for Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga. During this time Rubens was
  given access to the duke’s private collection—an assemblage of fine art from both
  the Classical and Renaissance periods which he studied assiduously. From Brussels,
  Archduke Albert, the regent of the Spanish Netherlands, had kept himself aware of
  Rubens’ progress abroad, and in 1602 he commissioned the artist to paint an altarpiece
  for Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Albert’s former titular church in Rome. While in
  Rome Rubens absorbed the lessons of both the High Renaissance (especially Michelangelo)
  and antiquity, including the Belvedere Torso and the Lacoön among other great works.
  He became enamored of the sculptural quality of human anatomy, an interest that
  would later become his speciality in collaborations with Jan Brueghel. </p><p>In
  1603 Rubens was sent as an emissary from the Gonzaga court to that of Philip III
  in Madrid. He remained there for a period of eight months from which time there
  is only one documented commission: the equestrian portrait of the Duke of Lerma
  (Madrid, Prado). Six years into his Italian sojourn, Rubens had already accomplished
  his first diplomatic mission and began to feel stifled by the Gonzaga court. He
  requested permission to remain in Rome, and with it granted he moved in with his
  brother on the Via de la Croce. While in Rome he received the commission to paint
  the altarpiece for the Oratorian Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella which was one
  of the most prestigious commissions available within the city at that time. The
  altarpiece came to completion in the same year as his Italian excursion. </p><p>In
  1608 Rubens left Italy for Antwerp to see his mother who had grown ill, but did
  not arrive until a few days after her death. Rubens vacillated; he was unsure whether
  he should return to the security of his fame in Italy or attempt to make a career
  for himself in Antwerp. He chose the latter option and within a few short years,
  his resolution to achieve renown in Antwerp proved successful. By the time Rubens
  returned to Antwerp, Jan Brueghel had become very well established as an artist
  and member of the elite community. He had served as both co-dean and dean of the
  Guild of Saint Luke, served as a painter to the court of Archduke Albert and Archduchess
  Isabella, and had enjoyed for roughly a decade membership in Confratum Collegij
  Romanorum apud Antuerpienses, a prestigious group of Antwerp citizens who had spent
  time in Rome. Through his close friendship with Brueghel, who introduced him to
  this community of Antwerp Romanists among other prominent social relations,and the
  swift growth of his own artistic reputation, Rubens quickly achieved eminent status
  within Antwerp society. Within the first year of his return he was commissioned
  to paint The Adoration of the Magi (Madrid, Prado) for the Antwerp town hall. In
  1609 he was appointed the court painter to Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella
  and enjoyed privileges similar to if not more extravagant than those allowed to
  Brueghel. With his standing in Antwerp established, he married. He bought for his
  new bride, Isabella Brant, and himself a home in the most posh area of Antwerp,
  while for his pupils and assistants he designed an adjacent studio in the Italian
  style. </p><p>Though features of his style —his distinct interest in in Classical
  subject matter, his mastery over the human form, and his preference for working
  on a large scale-- betray Italian influences, in Antwerp, Rubens modified elements
  of his artistic process to suit the aesthetic of the North in which he had been
  trained. One such alteration was his adoption of the collaborative method of production,
  a custom particularly characteristic of Antwerp’s artistic community in this period,
  which he had engaged in once before when he painted the Amazons with Jan Brueghel.
  His next collaboration, made jointly with Frans Snyders, was probably The Recognition
  of Philopoemen (Madrid, Prado). This was the beginning of another enduring collaborative
  relationship as he and Snyders would continue to create joint works until Rubens’s
  death. Apparent in his relationship with Snyders and these early collaborations
  is Rubens’ understanding of and commitment to creating works in concert. At times
  when Snyders followed Rubens’s design, their techniques were so similar that it
  is difficult to differentiate between the work of the two artists; Rubens approached
  the task of guiding their collaboration minded towards creating a work that represents
  at once cohesion in thought and the individual excellence of each painter. </p><p>The
  reciprocity of this sentiment between Rubens and Brueghel, coupled with the intimacy
  of their relationship, seems to indicate why the two artists were able to maintain
  such an unparalleled and prolific collaborative career. In addition to the roughly
  two-dozen unique works they created during their twenty-five year collaboration,
  Rubens and Brueghel worked together on more personal projects. On the altar above
  the tomb of Brueghel’s father, painter Pieter Bruegel, Rubens painted The Delivery
  of the Keys to Saint Peter and he also painted a portrait of Brueghel with his family
  (London, Courtauld Institute). Letters to friends and patrons, such as those written
  to Cardinal Borromeo, document their affection: Rubens often served as Brueghel’s
  secretary and transcribed Brueghel’s words in his own hand, while Brueghel recommended
  his friend’s work to his patron.</p><p>Though Rubens occupied a more illustrious
  position within the court, it was usually Brueghel, nine years Rubens’s senior,
  who acted as the lead for their joint compositions. Only one collaboration, The
  Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man (The Hague, Mauritshuis), bears the signatures
  of both artists, and a few more are marked with Brueghel’s alone. Clear in each
  work is that the two artists understood the collaborative process as one which provides
  the opportunity for study and improvement; at times they borrowed motifs from each
  other. They used the latest innovations, and likely the two artists usually worked
  on their collaborations without the assistance of their workshops. Their most well
  known shared works include The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus, The Garden
  of Eden with the Fall of Man, The Five Senses Series, and several versions of the
  same theme of The Madonna and Child with Flower Garland. </p><p>The two artists
  continued to collaborate until Brueghel’s death in 1625, the first of two deaths
  in the mid-1620s that would momentarily disrupt Rubens’s artistic career; the following
  year he lost his wife, Isabella Brant, to the plague. For eighteen months he turned
  to diplomacy as a distraction from his grief. During this time he was given the
  responsibility for traveling between England and Spain to negotiate peace for the
  Spanish Netherlands and was knighted twice, by the kings of each respective country.
  This diplomatic interlude gave him the opportunity to resume the study of art in
  a manner similar to that of his early career. While in Madrid he returned to his
  study of Titian’s works, made copies of his paintings (a revival of the duplication
  work from his time in the Gonzaga court), and befriended painter Diego Velasquez.
  Though he traveled to various European countries to make diplomatic negotiations
  he was able to complete with his workshop many impressive pieces. In the mid-1620s
  he returned to Antwerp briefly to paint The Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the
  Cathedral of Antwerp. Later, in 1629, while in London he painted the Allegory of
  Peace and War (London, National Gallery) which was given to Charles I as a gift.</p><p>As
  many times before in his life, he grew tired of the diplomatic profession and returned
  to Antwerp. In 1630 he remarried; he spent much of the ensuing decade with his new
  bride, the 16-year old Helen Fourment, and his young family. In the early 1630s
  he conducted two of his final commissions intended for public display: the Saint
  Ildefonso Altarpiece in memory of Archduke Albert and the triumphal entry into Antwerp
  for Archduke Ferdinand. After their completions he bought a country home, Chateau
  de Steen. There he spent his time painting landscapes–subject matter humble in comparison
  to that of the major public commissions that marked his career–and leading an increasingly
  private life until his death in May 1640. </p>"
