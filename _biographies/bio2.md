bio_text: "<p>Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia was the most prominent female patron
  of Jan Brueghel. The infanta was born on August 12, 1566 into the powerful Habsburg
  family. She was the eldest daughter of King Philip II and his third wife Elisabeth
  de Valois, who died just two years after Isabella’s birth. Subsequently, Isabella
  and her sister Catalina Micaela (one year her junior) were left in the care of Doña
  Johanna de Jacincourt, the mistress of the robes and in the latter half of Isabella’s
  life, her close friend. Though little is known about Isabella’s court education,
  she was reputed to be an adept horseman, skilled with an arquebus, and fluent in
  Portuguese, all of which skills endeared her to her father.</p><p>As the first-born
  child of King Philip II, Isabella was entitled to rule the Low Countries, but succession
  laws required that she take on a male consort before claiming her sovereign position.
  On April 18, 1599, Isabella was married to her cousin Archduke Albert of Austria
  with whom she ruled over the Habsburg Netherlands for more than twenty years. Had
  they had a child, he or she would have become sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands,
  but they did not. Nonetheless, the two decades of their joint rule were a momentous
  period characterized by their involvement in Spain’s response to the Dutch Revolt
  and by their formative patronage of baroque masters Jan Brueghel, and his longtime
  collaborative partner and friend, Peter Paul Rubens. </p><p>In fact, one of the
  most recognizable images of Isabella is the product of collaboration between Brueghel
  and Rubens; Infanta Isabella Before Mariemont Castle, was a joint project completed
  ca. 1615-18 during the most productive period of their collaborative career. As
  in most of their collaborations, Rubens was responsible for the human subject, Isabella
  herself, while Brueghel painted the landscape. Brueghel included in the background
  Mariemont Castle, one of the couple’s smaller homes but particularly beloved by
  the Infanta. Independently, Brueghel painted a number of scenes in which the couple
  interact with the Flemish peasantry, for example the Peasant Wedding Banquet with
  the Archdukes. These pieces have intrigued scholars for their portrayal of the sovereign
  figures on an intimate basis with the common population. They represented, for the
  rulers, a sense of mutual love between themselves and the people who worked their
  land.</p><p>In 1621, upon the death of her husband for whom she would later commission
  from Rubens the Saint Ildefonso “Altarpiece,” Isabella joined the Third Order of
  St. Francis as a nun. Although she wished to retire to the Convent of Poor Clares
  in Madrid, at the insistence of her nephew Philip IV she was reappointed to the
  position of Governor of the Netherlands. She held this office until her death on
  December 1, 1633. </p><p>So favored was she in popular memory that King Louis XIII
  of France wished to beatify her. Then her fame dwindled. Nearly three centuries
  later, in 1912, Countess Marie Hennequin de Villermont, a painter, writer, and proponent
  of feminist thought in the Belgian court, published the first biography of Isabella
  Clara Eugenia, two-volumes in length. </p>"
