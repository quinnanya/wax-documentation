bio_text: "<p>Because he was born to a Protestant family, Flemish painter and printmaker
  Adriaen van Stalbemt has no baptismal record. However, biographer Cornelius de Bie
  places his birthdate on June 12th, 1580. When he was five years old, Stalbemt’s
  family moved from Antwerp to Middleburg, where his formal training is believed to
  have taken place. Stalbemt returned to Antwerp in 1609. In 1610, he was admitted
  to the Guild of St. Luke, which he became dean of in 1617. Stalbemt married Barbara
  Verdelft on May 5th, 1613. The couple had one daughter who died in her youth. </p><p>Known
  for his ability in painting landscapes, staffage, and animals, Stalbemt is regarded
  as one of the more skilled imitators of Jan Brueghel the Elder. He is recorded as
  having a student in 1616 by the name of Hans Mesmaeckers. In 1618, he collaborated
  with Pieter Brueghel the Younger on a painting of David Slaying Goliath. His movements
  have been traced to London where he stayed for about ten months in 1633 after being
  invited by King Charles I. There, he painted two landscapes with the king and Queen
  Henrietta Maria. He died on September 21st, 1662.</p>"
