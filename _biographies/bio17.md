bio_text: "<p>Jan Noirot, at one time the Master of the Antwerp Mint, declared bankruptcy
  and abandoned his wife and nine children in 1572. A forced auction was held on September
  15th of that year to pay off his debt. The record of this auction reveals that Noirot
  owned around fifty paintings, five of which were painted by Pieter Bruegel. His
  art collection displays his interest in peasant revels, particularly clear in his
  selection of Bruegel works: one winter landscape, two peasant weddings, and two
  peasant kermis scenes. In his home, which itself was owned by the Antwerp Mint,
  the Bruegel paintings were divided among two rooms. Two peasant weddings, a peasant
  kermis, and the winter landscape were hung alongside family portraits and a painting
  of the Virgin Mary in a small back chamber adjoining the main dining room. The second
  peasant kermis was displayed next to a peasant wedding attributed to Hieronymous
  Bosch in an upper chamber of his home. A peasant wedding and peasant kermis, both
  recorded as painted in oils, are two of Noirot’s most expensive possessions; they
  cost 80 and 42 guilders respectively. Their price reflects the opulence of the oil
  medium. The other three paintings cost between 27-28 guilders presumably because
  they were painted in water-based tempera. Four of the paintings were painted on
  cloth (op doeck), while the fifth and most costly was painted on an undesignated
  support. As these paintings were auctioned only three years after Bruegel’s death
  in 1569, there is little dispute that they are Bruegel’s own.</p>"
