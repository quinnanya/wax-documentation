bio_text: "<p>Francesco Maria del Monte was an Italian cardinal, diplomat, art collector,
  and patron. Born in Venice in 1549, del Monte was the son Marquis Ranieri Bourbon
  del Monte and Minerva Pianosa. He came from a noble family from Pesaro with distant
  relations to the French royal House of Bourbon. Young Francesco Maria was educated
  at the court of Urbino and obtained a doctorate in law before beginning an ecclesiastical
  career as the Abbott commendatario of Santa Croce a Monte Fabali. In 1570, at the
  age of 21, Francesco moved to Rome. For the next decade, he worked in the courts
  of several Roman cardinals before arriving at the court of Cardinal Ferdinando de
  Medici in 1581. He was in his service until Medici resigned as cardinal to assume
  the position of Grand Duke of Tuscany. With Medici’s recommendation, Pope Sixtus
  V appointed Francesco as cardinal in 1588. Francesco took up residence in the Palazzo
  Madama, owned by Medici, in 1589. He served from 1606 to 1616 as the Prefect of
  the Sacred Congregation of the Council, and then became Prefect of the Sacred Congregation
  of Rites. He was also a prefect of the Fabbrica of St. Peter’s, a committee responsible
  for the basilica’s building.</p><p>Francesco interests outside his church career
  included alchemy and science. Along with his brother Guidobaldo, a mathematician,
  he helped Galileo get a professorship at the University of Pisa and defended him
  during the Inquisition. However, Francesco is best known for his patronage of the
  arts. As Cardinal, he was protector of the Sistine Chapel choir and the Congregazione
  dei Musici. He succeeded his friend Federico Borromeo as Cardinal Protector of the
  Accademia di S. Luca in Rome in 1595. Del Monte was also the first major patron
  of Caravaggio, whose naturalist style he favored. The first two works he acquired
  by the artist, The Gypsy Fortune-Teller and The Cardsharps, still exist today, as
  do many others he would acquire throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Francesco was connected
  with many the other major patrons, including the Medici family, Cardinal Benedetto
  Giustiniani, and Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Although he owned works by fifteenth-century
  old masters, he was known for his support of contemporary art, a patron of artists
  such as Simon Vouet, Antiveduto Grammatica, Andrea Sacchi, and Gerrit van Honthorst.
  Like his contemporary Borromeo, he was also an early patron of Flemish landscape
  painter Jan Brueghel. He would come to own at least seventeen paintings by Brueghel.
  The first inventory of his art collection, done a year after his death in 1626,
  lists a total of 599 paintings, many of them displayed in the Palazzo Madama. The
  majority of these were portraits, religious themes, and landscapes. One third were
  works by old masters, including Leonardo, Raphael, and Titian. The rest were all
  by contemporary artists. This vast and varied collection built over a lifetime-
  now dispersed in museums and other private collections- ensured Francesco’s position
  as a major patron and, in fact, his monument boasts that he was an “excellent patron
  of the good arts”. </p>"
