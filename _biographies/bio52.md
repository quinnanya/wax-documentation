bio_text: "<p>Jan Brueghel the Younger was an artist and art dealer, born in Antwerp
  on September 13th, 1601. He was eldest son of Jan Brueghel the Elder and his first
  wife Isabella De Jode. From an early age, Brueghel was exposed to the art world.
  He belonged to the eminent Brueghel family of painters, as the child of Jan I, nephew
  of Pieter II, and grandchild of Pieter I. His mother’s father was the engraver Gerard
  De Jode and he was the godchild of Peter Paul Rubens. He followed in his father’s
  professional footsteps, as was then customary, and began his artistic training in
  his father’s studio at the age of 10. This was followed by a trip to Italy, then
  a rite of passage for young artists throughout Europe, where he stayed briefly with
  his father’s patron, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. He then left for Sicily and was
  in Palermo by 1623. His father and three brothers died of cholera in 1625, leaving
  young Jan the new patriarch of the Brueghel family. Shortly after their deaths,
  he returned to Antwerp and married Anna Maria Janssens, the daughter of painter
  Abraham Janssens, on July 5th, 1626. The couple would have eleven children, including
  five sons who would go on to be painters themselves. With the exceptions of a few
  short journeys, such as one to Paris in 1651, he remained in Antwerp for the rest
  of his life, managing and continuing the Brueghel legacy. He died on September 1st,
  1678.</p><p>In his father’s workshop, Brueghel’s tasks had likely included making
  copies of his father’s pictures and helping the paid assistants with their work.
  This training made him familiar with his father’s style and that influence would
  be evident in his works throughout his life, to the point where art historians frequently
  have trouble differentiating between a later Jan I and an early Jan II. The few
  noticeable differences between father and son include different brushwork and more
  negative space in the paintings of the younger Brueghel. He did establish himself
  as an independent artist and, in 1625, joined the St. Lucas guild. He would become
  deacon of the guild between 1630 and 1631. As a painter, his themes—like those of
  his father--included still-lifes, Christian narratives, mythological scenes, water
  scenes, rustic scenes, animals, and allegories. He too was a prolific painter of
  landscapes. Brueghel’s biggest commissions were the 1630 Adam Cycle for the French
  royal court and a group of works for the Austrian court, completed in 1651.</p><p>As
  had also been his father’s practice, Brueghel frequently collaborated with other
  artists. He worked with his father’s collaborator Hendrik van Balen until the latter’s
  death in 1632. Van Balen was known for his work with figures for which Brueghel
  provided the landscapes and still life details. Through his father Brueghel also
  knew Peter Paul Rubens, the foremost painter of the period. He worked sometimes
  with Rubens but more often with one of the many artists in Rubens’ studio. His contributions
  then consisted primarily of still-life work. In addition, Brueghel’s journals mention
  working with Abraham Janssens, Lucas van Uden, David Teniers the Younger, Adriaen
  van Stalbemt, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Abraham van Diepenbeek, Jan van Kessel, Frans Wouters,
  and Gonzales Coques. In many cases no instances of such collaboration can be identified
  today.</p><p>Alongside his painting, Brueghel also maintained a very successful
  and profitable career as an art dealer. He completed many of his father’s unfinished
  works after his death and sold these alongside his own works. He also either altered
  or copied some of his father’s sketches for his own work and sold copies of his
  father’s paintings, helping to perpetuate the Brueghel legacy. Brueghel’s work can
  be found in private collections and museums such as the Alte Pinakothek (Munich),
  the Getty (Los Angeles) and the Metropolitan (New York).</p>"
