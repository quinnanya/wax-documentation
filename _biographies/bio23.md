bio_text: "<p>Born just before the turn of the sixteenth century in Croatia , Giulio
  Clovio (1498-1587) is one of the most famous and accomplished miniature painters
  and illuminators of the Italian Renaissance. In around 1516, Clovio moved to Italy,
  a crucial step in launching his artistic career. He first worked in Venice, serving
  the Cardinal Domenico Grimani. Under Grimani’s patronage, Clovio had the opportunity
  to go to Rome, and it was there that he met fellow painter Giulio Romano and was
  exposed to other great artists of the time.</p><p>Clovio’s works marry monumental
  figures to a miniature scale and incorporate the level of detail usually associated
  with northern artists. Clovio was specifically influenced by the works of Michelangelo
  and Albrecht Dürer. Clovio served King Louis II and Queen Maria of Hungary, and
  then Cardinal Campeggio until the sack of Rome in 1527. After being taken prisoner
  by the troops of Charles V, Clovio escaped and fled to Padua to become a Benedictine
  having, according to Vasari, vowed to join a monastery if God would deliver him
  from the Spaniards. Clovio briefly returned to the service of Cardinal Grimani,
  but in 1540, he began to work for his final patron, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese.
  While serving Cardinal Farnese, Clovio produced what is held by many to be his great
  masterpiece, Farnese Hours (1546).</p><p>In 1553, Clovio briefly returned to Rome
  where he met Pieter Breugel. The two are thought to have collaborated on the Towneley
  Lectionary. Clovio returned to Florence, working under the patronage of Cardinal
  Farnese until Clovio’s death in 1578. Known for his miniatures, Giulio Clovio was
  a brilliant painter, who, according to Vasari, produced in his paintings some of
  the “greatest things that mortal hand could do or mortal eye could behold” (Vasari
  249). Clovio’s own personal collection also contained the work of contemporary masters.
  His 1577 inventory includes four paintings by Pieter Bruegel, all now lost, “the
  View of Lyons, […] a Tower of Babel painted on ivory, a study of a tree on linen,
  and a miniature on which the two painters had collaborated.</p>"
