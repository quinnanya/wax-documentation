bio_text: "<p>Giulio Cesare Procaccini was an Italian artist born in Bologna who worked
  mostly in Milan. Likely trained under Francesco Brambilla, Procaccini was a skilled
  sculptor who worked for several years on facades and statues for Milan’s Cathedral,
  Santa Maria presso San Celso, and the Cremona Cathedral. </p><p>Around 1600, Procaccini
  shifted his focus from sculpting to painting. He painted frescoes in cathedrals
  across Milan. </p><p>While Procaccini’s late stylistic choices mirror earlier styles
  of art, his use of drapery and light set his work apart from preceding periods.
  He was heavily influenced by mannerism-- the chosen style of his father, Ercole
  Procaccini the Elder-- and Venetian colorism, and his latest works seem to anticipate
  Baroque style. He collaborated with Jan Brueghel on <em>Garland with the Virgin
  and Child and two Angels</em> in 1619. </p>"
