bio_text: "<p>The records of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp show that Hieronymus
  Cock was admitted to the guild in 1546; the date suggests that he was born in around
  1520. He and his brother Matthys were sons of the painter Jan de Cock who is recorded
  as having accepted pupils in 1506 and 1516. Matthys was the elder given that he
  accepted a pupil in 1540, six years before Cock was received as a master in the
  guild. The date given by Van Mander for Cock’s death, 1570, is confirmed by a document
  published by Rombouts and Van Lerius. According this this source, he died on October
  3rd and was buried in the Predikherenkerk in Antwerp.</p><p>Presumably Cock was
  trained as a painter in his father’s shop and, after his father’s death, that of
  his brother. He was received into the guild as a painter, but we know no paintings
  by his hand. He was the designer of sixty-two etchings, however, and is even more
  famous as the proprietor of the printing house as of 1550 known as “The Four Winds.”</p><p>Indeed,
  examination of Cock’s prints suggests that even this aspect of his artistic output
  was subordinate to the needs of his publishing business. Of the sixty-two etchings
  which he produced beginning in 1548, forty date from the years 1550-51 when his
  business was just beginning. The remaining appeared at the rate of one or two a
  year until 1558, when the set “Landscapes with Biblical and Mythological Scenes”
  closed Cock’s career as an etcher. As a publisher, Cock’s responsibility was to
  bear the business’s financial risks and political and social accountability. In
  doing so successfully, Cock became immensely wealthy, purchasing one house after
  another.</p><p>Van Mander praised Cock as being himself an inventive landscapist.
  Landscape was also the first field in which he published the designs of Pieter Bruegel.
  In 1554, Pieter Bruegel’s landscape drawing (without figures) was adapted by Cock
  for an etched narrative, “Landscape with the Temptation of Christ.” Between 1555
  and 1557, Cock produced a series of landscapes after Bruegel designs, the so-called
  “Large Landscapes.” Most of these were based on drawings Bruegel had made of mountainous
  landscapes during his trip to Italy.</p><p>During the 1550’s Bruegel made a variety
  of designs for Cock. These included religious and allegorical subjects (the famous
  Seven Virtues and Seven Vices series) and subjects pertaining to human folly and
  proverbial wisdom. Bruegel’s prints for Cock often partake of the satirical vernacular
  verbal structures of urban Antwerp. </p>"
