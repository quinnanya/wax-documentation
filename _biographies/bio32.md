bio_text: "<p>A Flemish painter and engraver, David Teniers (the Younger) was born
  on December 15, 1610 in Antwerp. As the first son of painter David Teniers the Elder
  and Dymphna Wylde, he was involved with art by the age of sixteen when he began
  formally studying under his father. Developing specializations in religious themes,
  rustic and landscape scenes, and interior pieces, by 1633 he had become a master
  in the Antwerp Guild. Four years later, on July 4, 1637, he married Anna Bruegel,
  the daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder; through this marriage, he grew close to
  the Brueghel family and their important connections, like fellow Flemish artist
  Peter Paul Rubens. It was during this time that he engaged in artistic collaborations
  with his brother in law, Jan Brueghel the Younger; a prominent example of this is
  the 1642 Armorer’s Shop, in which Teniers painted the overall scene, including the
  armorer and his shop, and Brueghel painted the details of armor that lay near their
  creator. Throughout the 1640s and beyond, Teniers’ standing as a successful artist
  increased greatly: in 1644, he became the dean of the St. Luke Guild in Antwerp
  and in 1650 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of the Spanish Netherlands named him court
  painter. In this position, he curated and maintained Wilhelm’s collection, expanding
  it to contain about 1,300 pieces, featuring works of famous Italian masters such
  as Raphael and Titian. Teniers also incorporated pieces by famed Northern artists,
  mixing works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan van Eyck into the collection. On
  May 11, 1656, his wife Anna died; within a year Teniers remarried, wedding Isabella
  de Fren with whom he had four children. He left his position as court painter in
  1659. Four years later, in 1663, Teniers founded the Antwerp Academy to teach students
  Flemish styles of drawing and sculpture; as he grew older, he also worked as an
  art dealer and an organizer of auctions. He died on April 25, 1690 at age 80.</p>"
