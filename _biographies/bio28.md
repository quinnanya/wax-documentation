bio_text: "<p>Jan van Kessel was born in April 5th, 1626 to Hieronymus van Kessel
  and Paschasia Brueghel. His father was an accomplished animal painter and a member
  of the St. Luke’s Guild, which gave his son early exposure to the art world. However,
  it was through his mother’s family that van Kessel had access to the full range
  of European artistic methods and training. She belonged to the Brueghel family of
  artists and was the grand-daughter of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, daughter of Jan
  Brueghel the Elder, and sister of Jan Brueghel the Younger. Van Kessel’s father
  left Antwerp in 1636 and his nine-year old son remained to be trained by Simon de
  Vos and his uncle, Jan II Brueghel. In 1644, when he was nineteen, he joined Antwerp’s
  St. Luke’s Guild himself, registering as a flower painter. In 1655, he married Maria
  van Apshoven. The couple would go on to have thirteen children and at least two
  of van Kessel’s sons, Ferdinand and Jan II, would become painters. Van Kessel produced
  works for the rest of his life, until his death in 1679, at age fifty-three.</p><p>Though
  van Kessel’s art is not entirely defined by his family, the Brueghel legacy did
  have a significant impact on him. Trained by his uncle, Jan the Younger, he was
  exposed to the Brueghel style, which carried much weight in European art markets.
  Van Kessel used this to his advantage by adopting some family motifs and themes
  at the beginning of his career. But while his uncle’s works were often direct copies
  of his famous father and grandfather, Van Kessel moved away from this practice as
  he grew older, reworking the past and adding new themes to his family’s legacy.
  The best example of this is his initial choice to specialize in flower and garland
  painting, a genre closely associated with his grandfather, Jan Brueghel the Elder.
  These early works allowed him to establish himself as a talented artist in the Brueghel
  lineage, and also gave him the opportunity to collaborate with major artists in
  Antwerp, some of whom were friends of his family. But Van Kessel quickly branched
  out to new subject matters and would go on to explore landscapes, religious themes,
  and allegorical subjects.</p><p>At the height of his career, van Kessel produced
  the miniature scale paintings which would become some of his most enduring works.
  The small pictures were done on copper and featured subject matter such as insects,
  shells, and animals. Their diminutive scale emphasized van Kessel’s extreme attention
  to detail, further highlighted by his deft brushwork and composition. He was especially
  praised for his depictions of insects and his almost scientifically accurate observations
  of their bodies. Van Kessel’s miniatures were meant to be seen together and his
  series sometimes numbered as many as forty individual pieces, placed together to
  form a single thematically cohesive work. One of these series is The Four Parts
  of the World (Munich, Alte Pinakothek) in which van Kessel depicts the continents
  of Africa, Asia, Europe, and America. Each part is made up of one large painting,
  surrounded by smaller images, each representing an aspect of the region. Van Kessel
  would complete many such allegories during his lifetime. They earned him acclaim
  in his own right, independent of his family, and firmly established his place in
  the European art world. Today, about five hundred works can be attributed to him.</p>"
