bio_text: "<p>The fifth son to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain,
  herself the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Isabella of Portugal, Albrecht
  (or Albert) of Austria was born on November 13, 1559. Expected to pursue a clerical
  career, he was sent to Spain for an ecclesiastical education under King Philip II
  at age eleven. In 1577, the then-eighteen year old was appointed cardinal by Pope
  Gregory XIII. It was intended that Albrecht become the Archbishop of Toledo, but
  the position did not open to succession until 1594, over ten years after Albrecht
  had become First Viceroy of Portugal and its overseas empire as well as the country’s
  Papal Legate and Grand Inquisitor.</p><p>In 1593, he left Portugal to take a leading
  role in the Spanish monarchy as the head of the Junta de Gobierno, a political collective
  that Philip II created to train his son, Prince Philip, in the workings of the monarchy
  so he could take over when his father grew too old. Albrecht remained in this position
  until 1595, when his brother, Archduke Ernst, died. He was then sent to Brussels
  to succeed him as Governor General of Habsburg Netherlands. In 1598, the now Archduke
  Albrecht resigned from the cardinalate and a year later he married the Infanta Isabella
  Clara Eugenia, his cousin. The couple became avid patrons of the arts, appointing
  Jan Brueghel the Elder as their court painter in 1606. Unfortunately they had no
  children to succeed them in ruling The Netherlands. On July 31, 1621, Archduke Albrecht
  died, and his wife continued as sole governor until her own death. </p>"
