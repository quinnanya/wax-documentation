bio_text: "<p>Hieronymus Bosch was born as Jeroen van Aken in around 1450 to a family
  of established artists. His father was Antonius van Aken and his grandfather was
  Jan van Aken. Little is known about Bosch’s early life but he was probably trained
  as a painter by a family member. In his early thirties, he married Aleyt van den
  Mervenne, a wealthy woman from a prominent family, which suggests that his own family
  was also socially well-situated. Eventually, he adopted the pseudonym Hieronymus
  Bosch, probably referring to his home town of ‘s-Hertogenbosch or Den Bosch.</p><p>In
  1488, he became a sworn member of the Brotherhood of Our Lady, a religious organization
  in 's-Hertogenbosch. His membership proved pivotal to his artistic career, as his
  first commissions came from the Brotherhood. He would go on to secure a number of
  other commissions through his connections with the Brotherhood and would become
  a leading artist in the region. He died and was buried in 1516 in the same town
  where he was born. His art had a strong impact on his contemporaries and on the
  generations of artists that followed.</p><p>Bosch’s interpretation or representation
  of religion appears very different from that of his contemporaries. Indeed, his
  distinct perspective played a significant role in the endurance of his art into
  modern times. Bosch viewed mankind with a pessimistic eye and evidently believed
  that most humans could not be saved. As a result, his works are often moralizing
  and he is well-known for his damning depictions of vice and sin, which were meant
  to reflect the folly of humanity’s inherently excessive and impulsive nature. He
  also occasionally moved away from explicitly Christian scenes, opting instead for
  secular yet still moralizing subjects. Bosch was especially interested in condemning
  what he considered to be base social actions. Some of his beliefs were inspired
  by Christian doctrine, such as his criticism of gluttony and greed. But he also
  critiqued habits more common in daily Netherlandish life, such as laziness, drunkenness,
  and lawlessness. He was especially critical of lust and sexuality, which he depicted
  as the culmination of mankind’s inclination towards indulgence of bodily pleasures.</p><p>Bosch’s
  formal and iconographical techniques also distinguish him from other sixteenth-century
  artists. He reworked traditional, even vernacular symbols to express religious and
  ethical views. He populated his paintings with invented symbolic characters meant
  to represent some virtue or vice of daily life. He used criminals, low-class workers,
  and prostitutes to represent the moral failings of humanity, but he also included
  figures of virtue to contrast with these. He favored hermit saints, whose ascetic
  lifestyle was something to be praised. Bosch is also well-known for his fantastical
  creatures and his outlandish depictions of Hell. However, even these images are
  a result of his moral attitudes. His work is especially characterized by eschatological
  thinking.</p><p>Bosch left a significant impact on the Netherlandish art world and
  was influential to artists like Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Bruegel was born about
  a decade after Bosch’s death and was exposed to Bosch’s style and themes early in
  his artistic career. This is especially evident in his early engravings, in which
  he imitated Bosch’s methods of invention, particularly his signifying fantastical
  creatures. He was also inspired by Bosch’s religious themes. The impact of Bosch’s
  secular art can also be found in Bruegel’s genre imagery. Like Bosch, Bruegel populated
  his art with common people and scenes of their everyday lives. Bosch also influenced
  Bruegel’s son, Jan Brueghel the Elder, and his artwork. Though the younger Brueghel
  operated in a vastly different art market than his predecessors, one now dominated
  by wealthy collectors, he still employed many of Bosch’s distinctive techniques.
  This includes Bosch’s peculiar depictions of Hell and its weird creatures, often
  reimagined in a Classical context for Brueghel’s elite audience.</p>"
