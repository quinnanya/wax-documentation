bio_text: "<p>Hendrick van Balen was born in 1575 to the merchant Willem van Balen
  and Mechtelt van Aelten. A resident of Antwerp for most of his life, he became a
  master (Freimeister) in the city’s Guild of St. Luke (1592/3) before embarking on
  a trip to Italy. During his time there, he either met or studied the works of Hans
  Rottenhammer, and he was also heavily influenced by the work of Tintoretto. In 1609,
  back in Antwerp, he was named deacon of the painters’ guild. He was also constantly
  praised as liefhebber, a term describing a painter or lay patron who demonstrated
  acute and learned appreciation of contemporary art. For example, Van Balen received
  this accolade together with Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder for procuring
  a work painted by Caravaggio. Van Balen was intimately connected to Rubens and Brueghel
  in both professional and social capacities: they collaborated on paintings and shared
  drawings, and public records attest to their mutual appointments as godparents as
  well as intermarriage in the next generation. Van Balen regularly worked alongside
  contemporaries outside of this trio, including Anthony van Dyck, one of his many
  pupils. He married the middle-class Margareta Briers (1604) and fathered eleven
  children, three of whom—Jaspar, Hendrick the Younger, and Jan, the most successful—became
  painters. He died on July 17, 1632.</p><p>Of a total 219 works attributed to Van
  Balen by Bettina Werche, 76 are either confidently or tentatively identified as
  collaborations with Jan Brueghel the Elder. Their earliest work together—“The Judgment
  of Paris” (Berlin) —was painted in 1600. Van Balen’s oeuvre, as described by Werche,
  spans three periods and several genres. The first period starts with his ascension
  as Freimeister and covers his early works through 1608. Van Balen absorbed the late
  Mannerist tendencies of Italian art in the 1590s, yet the works produced after his
  return to Antwerp demonstrate a reinvigorated Flemish influence on his figuration.
  The second period of 1609–25 involves the radical adoption of Rubens’ style as well
  as its subversion, particularly through his characteristically small format. Finally,
  the third period of 1625–32 is bounded by the deaths of Brueghel and Van Balen.
  At this time Van Balen concentrated more on central, plot-driven scenes by painting
  fewer and larger figures. The productive cooperation between the Brueghel and Van
  Balen families continued in this period with Jan Breughel the Younger’s contributions
  to about 50 works, although Hendrick’s son Jan van Balen would sever the connection
  upon his father’s death.</p><p>Van Balen painted altars, designed stained glass
  windows, and engaged with the copper plate as a medium, but he is best known for
  his myriad cabinet paintings (Kabinettbilder). Through most of his career, he painted
  heavily populated scenes related to mythology, allegory, and biblical history with
  a preference for nude female mythical figures and personifications. In the realm
  of religious iconography, Van Balen contributed to the development of the floral
  wreath (Blumenkränzen) type of Madonna and Child depiction.</p>"
