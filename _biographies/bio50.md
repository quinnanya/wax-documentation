bio_text: "<p>Frans Francken the Younger was born in Antwerp in 1581 to painter Frans
  Francken the Elder and Elisabeth Mertens. He was exposed to the Flemish art world
  from an early age by his father, Frans the Elder, and his uncle, Hieronymus Francken.
  Alongside his older brother, Hieronymus II, he trained under his father in Antwerp
  and under his uncle in Paris. As a young man in 1605, he became a master at the
  Guild of St. Luke, and would go on to hold a number of high-ranking positions in
  the guild, eventually becoming deacon in 1616. By 1607, he had his own workshop;
  and in November of that year, he married Elisabeth Plaquet. The couple would have
  nine children and at least two of their sons, Frans III and Hieronymus III, would
  become painters themselves. Francken enjoyed a critically and commercially successful
  career and had a significant role in the development of early seventeenth-century
  Flemish art. He died on May 6, 1642, having cemented his family’s artistic legacy
  and secured his own.</p><p>Francken was a highly prolific artist and sold originals
  as well as copies and prints of his works. Though Francken was a technically skilled
  artist, it was his development of new subject matter that had the most profound
  effect on Flemish art. While his output included many traditional subjects with
  historical, allegorical, and religious themes, he is best known for his invention
  of several new genres. Among these are his famous “monkey kitchen” works, which
  present traditional genre scenes acted out by monkeys. These usually had some sort
  of moral message or were read as commentary on human society. Francken was also
  the inventor of the “art collection” picture or paintings that depicted other works
  of art. He finished the first of these in 1914. It was this predilection for strange
  and offbeat subjects that would make Francken such a popular figure in the Flemish
  art market.</p><p>Francken worked with a number of collaborators, including Tobias
  Verhaecht, Abraham Govaerts, Hans Jordaens III, Hendrik van Steenwijk I, and his
  brother, Hieronymus Francken. Among his collaborators was also Jan Brueghel the
  Elder. Francken had been influenced by Jan’s father, Pieter Bruegel, and he in turn
  acted as an inspiration for Jan. The younger Brueghel was interested in Francken's
  unconventional themes and compositions, and often contributed flowers and other
  background details to Francken’s paintings. It can be assumed through their numerous
  collaborations that they had a close working relationship. Jan was particularly
  engaged by Francken’s imaginary art gallery paintings, in which Francken often depicted
  artworks similar to those Jan was painting, so that Francken’s pictures represent
  a dialogue of ideas between the two artists.</p>"
