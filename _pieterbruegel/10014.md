general_notes: 'Provenance note: "[1] The picture first came to notice when it was
  bought by Fernand Stuyck at public auction at the Fievez Gallery, Brussels, in 1924.
  It was then catalogued simply as Flemish school, seventeenth century. In December
  of that year, when it was cleaned by the elder Mr. Buesco, conservator for the Belgian
  royal family, the signature and date were revealed. The painting came to the United
  States just before World War II. It was then shown in San Francisco and Washington,
  D.C."'
