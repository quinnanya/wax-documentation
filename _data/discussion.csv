2,2876,"E.A. Honig","<p>This work is very closely related to version in the Colonna collection. Possibly a contemporary autograph copy that Jan took back to Antwerp and formed the basis of further variants executed there; or could this be the one listed in Giustiniani inventory in 1601? I also find it very possible that all the Magi paintings were executed in Antwerp, where the theme is local and the visual materials to hand, and then sent to patrons in Rome (as he was doing for Borromeo). But if any versions were executed in Rome they are this and the Colonna painting.</p>","June 4, 2012"

6,2879,"E.A. Honig","<p>A close variant of Vienna and London paintings which is now accepted by Ertz but it's just not consistent. Some of the figures are really good (the crowd is lively and interesting) and others are awful--like, actually the 3 kings are all terrible, as if the artist just wasn't interested.  A good example of a studio piece: executed alongside or shortly after autograph ones, possibly with some intervention of the artist  but not a fully autograph, first-rate piece. Also it's not a direct copy--the space where the crowd gathers on the left is not so good (they are too isocephalic) and the middle- and background don't repeat any other version exactly. You have a sense that there were drawings around that were mixed and matched.</p>","April 5, 2014"

14,2884,"Jaco Rutgers","<p>This could very well be the painting mentioned in a Roman document as having been painted for Enrico Caetani, cardinale di Sermoneta (probably dating to the first months of 1593): ""scudi 22 a Giovanni Brughel pittore per un quadro dell'Incendio di Troia."" The painting is mentioned again in a 1665 inventory of the Caetani collection, and so is: un ""Inferno e quantità di diverse figure dipinte sopra rame"" (both pictures with the same dimensions, no painter mentioned though).

20,2890,"E.A. Honig","<p>This is a variant of the Colonna version. However, when I compare the two main figures in this work to those in the Colonna work, these are just much less well done. Moreover, this entire painting is spatially and conceptually inferior, confused and incoherent. And yet -- this is an independent composition, not just a copy by any means; so if Jan didn't do it, who did? Surely he did not have a studio in Rome that was putting together works in this way. So how to explain it?</p><p>This painting bridges the gap between the Colonna picture and the rest of the Aeneas and Sibyl pictures because it's starting to have some nude figures (specific ones that are repeated in other Aeneas scenes) but it also has the torture wheel and other Boschian stuff. When Lilian had this picture he also had, as a pendant to this, an Aeneas Saving Anchises which was dated 1593 (a date that I doubt). There is no reason that they must have been pendants originally: the two could have been brought together at any time, since almost all of Jan's works from this period are on same-sized copper plates. No Roman patron is recorded as owning both of Brueghel's subjects from the Aeneid, although that would have been perfectly logical .</p>","May 28, 2012"
21,2891,"E.A. Honig","<p>Narrative comes from the Aeneid book VI. </p><p>Note that there are two versions of this subject in Budapest, their inventory #s 551 & 553. They are frequently confused in the literature, including in Ertz 1979.  551 (the present painting) is the one where Sibyl is in the lead and 553 has Aeneas in the lead. </p><p>Previously it was thought that the figures were by Rottenhammer. that was Gerson's opinion; Freedberg too is not totally convinced by the attribution of figures to Brueghel. I believe them to be by him.</p>","June 12, 2012"
22,2892,"E.A. Honig","<p>A fascinating copy/variant of this work was painted by Frans Francken: Harting 1989, p.50 & #275a. It was exhibited Munich 2013, cat. # 39: copper, 27 x 40.8; Munich, Bayer. Staatsgem.sam., inv. #1879. This would be a very early work by Francken, before he was even a master in the guild, and suggests his strong early connections to Brueghel's studio.</p>","April 17, 2013"
23,2893,"E.A. Honig","<p>Subject is from the Aeneid, vi.269-282 </p><p>There are versions of this composition attributed to Jan the Younger in Brussels MBA (Ertz, Jan Brueghel the Younger, #130; Brussels inv. #6249); Ertz JBII #131 in Hardy Collection, Bendorf; and Ertz #132 in Antwerp, Kronacker collection.  Ertz says that these were all produced by Jan Brueghel the Younger in the 1630s, but how would such replication 30+ years later be possible?  How do we know they are that late? There is another copy in the Metropolitan Museum of Art which they too date to 1630-40 and attribute to Jan the Younger. It seems likely to me that these versions were produced at the same time as the original in Jan’s workshop. All are of the same size and on copper supports. Relatedly, the figure groupings in this work are taken from groupings that Rottenhammer had provided for Brueghel's Dresden Juno in the Underworld. However, the groups are placed now on opposite sides of the plate than they were in the Juno. Three of the men are in the lower right corner but the fourth man, who had not been tangled with the others, has been moved over to the left and lies next to the group of women. This is interesting in terms of how Jan used drawings in his studio practice. Comparing Brussels version to the present work, there are actually tons of little differences in the details. The basic larger figure groupings and the general disposition of the landscape are identical but many, many smaller figures, animals, demons, hellish machines etc. are different. It could easily be copied from a group of study drawings, for instance.  In size, the Brussels painting (also on copper) is almost identical to this one; the other two versions are very close as well.I also note that the supposed Jan the Younger painting sold by Robert Fink in 1962 is a terrible picture but is actually closer in some details to the original, has things from this work that the (better) Brussels painting does not have. Yet there are also elements in the Fink painting that seem to be from the Brussels painting (or one like it) and not from the original. How is this possible? Possibly the Brussels painting is the key secondary version from which a work like the Fink painting derives.One of these copies was sold Christies, London, July 4 1997 #239; the plate it was on had a P. Staes stamp on the back, if that helps with dating. There is also a variant in Munich (copper, 27 x 41) that Harting attributed to Frans II Francken. Clearly indeed by another hand than the rest, very odd. Harting cat. #275A, illustrated on p.51.</p>","June 4, 2012"
24,2893,"E.A. Honig","<p>Note on possible early provenance from Sotheby's:  A painting described as ""Enea condotto dalla Sibilla negli Elisei, di Brueghel d'Enfer"" is listed in the 1848 inventory of Giovanni Andrea Colonna, Rome, no. 392. By this date Brueghel's three other versions of this subject (mentioned above) are known to be in their current locations, two in the Szepmuveszeti Muzeum, Budapest, and the other in the Kaiserhaus, Vienna (later entering the Kunsthistorisches Museum). It is thus possible that the present work is identifiable with the Colonna painting. The earlier Colonna inventory of 1783, made by Filippo III Colonna, lists only a pair of works described as: ""Due Quadri di 1 1/2 per traverso, uno rappresentante Orfeo, ed Euridice all'Inferno, l'altro Enea agli Elisi = Bruguel Infernale"".  Again, the present work may be identifiable with the second of the pair, fitting both the description and the dimension (no painting identifiable with the former, depicting Orpheus and Euridice, is known today and is either lost or the subject was mis-identified by the inventory compiler). No painting specifically mentioning Aeneas appears in the 1714 Colonna inventory, but the descriptions here are, in general, extremely vague. Whether identifiable with the present work or not, the painting mentioned in the 1848 inventory may have entered the Colonna collection through marriage, which would explain its non-appearance in the 1714 inventory. On the other hand it is conceivable that Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, the artist's patron in Rome from 1592-94, commissioned it directly from Brueghel, who had returned to Antwerp two years before its execution, in 1596, and the subject is simply unidentified in subsequent inventories.</p>","June 4, 2012"
25,2895,"E.A. Honig","<p>Motifs from this painting and from the version of the same subject in Budapest (Ertz 1979 #66) are combined in the following works with the same subject: Brussels, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten; private collection in Antwerp; picture formerly with Christie’s, London (sold 4.vii.97 #239).

Variant in Glasgow, Art Gallery.</p><p>There has been some back and forth about both attribution and dating on this work and the Berlin version. Ertz accepts current work, attributes Berlin version to Jan the Younger. Werche says that both must be by same Brueghel and she votes for Jan the Younger; however, she says that style of figures points to date of ca. 1608. Therefore her hypothesis is that there was a lost prototype by Jan the Elder and Van Balen from ca. 1608 and both of these works must be copies from ca. 1625 by Jan the Younger and Van Balen. My impression from good photographs was that Berlin painting is not quite as good as present work, and therefore present work has some chance of being that original as Ertz now agrees (w/ earlier date).</p>","May 12, 2014"

This copy is signed by Van Balen but not Brueghel, whereas the present work is signed by Jan Brueghel and not Van Balen.

In Jan the Younger's journal in 1626, there is an entry that records a Forge of Vulcan executed with Van Balen, in which (he notes) Venus is pointing to the arms of the Duke of Savoy.   In the Christie's picture what Venus is pointing to in Vulcan's shield is the arms of the king of France (Vulcan is also pointing to that coat of arms):  the arms, 3 fleurs de lys, are encircled by 2 chains, one of which is attached to the badge of the order of St. Esprit.  The rest of the armor on the ground also displays this motif.   This must have been a commission.  Catalogue (Christie's) says that the armor seems to be Milanese and to date from the second half of the 16th century.</p><p>This is the picture from which #276, that odd work in Munich, is an excerpt .

The originals has been at Tervuren (inventories of 1677, 1701, 1708).</p><p>According to Díaz Padrón in Brussels 1985, Jan Brueghel's part was limited t the flowers, the animals, the pseudo-engravings, the instruments, and the garland painting at the lower right.

There is a Bacchanal with Leopards (now in Montreal) that is mentioned in Rubens's famous letter to Dudley Carlton, and a Tiger and Leopard Hunt (now in Dresden). According to Díaz Padrón, Francken copied these works here, while Jan Brueghel copied them in Madrid's Sense of Sight. They were not part of the Archducal collection.

He also hypothesized that in the original works, the paintings at the right had been ""originals"" by specific artists while those in the gallery to the rear, which replicate known works, were filled in by Frans Francken. In the Brussels 1985 catalogue he wavered between attributing the figures to Van Balen or to Rubens toning down his style to harmonize with a collaborator. Ertz's attribution of the works to Jan the Younger is impossible: he was in Italy in the years before they were sent to Spain and would surely not have been entrusted with a major royal commission in his teens.

It is obvious that the present work was the first conceived, for it is impossible to imagine that a second version would show more recognisable details than a first version. To that regard it is important to compare the monkeys sitting on the cupboard. As where the middle monkey is merely a suggestion of an animal in the "" singerie II "", one can clearly see it is a monkey giving an ox to the monkey left of him in the present work. The detailing in the clothing of the persons on the two portraits hanging high left is also a lot more apparent . The clothing of the woman is very similar to the ""Parisian style"" clothing appearing on the ""portrait of Jacqueline van Caestre"" by Rubens or Van Dijck dating from late 1617 or first halve of 1618.</p>","June 24, 2014"

The two artists used Albrecht Dürer's The Harrowing of Hell, or Christ in Limbo from the Engraved Passion; B.16, as the basis for their composition.

This is quite a stretch: the animals in the present work are clearly related to ones in earlier paradise landscapes and not at all to the ones he was executing by ca. 1615. Furthermore, Jan stresses in his letters that the ""picture with animals"" is the same size as his (first) flower painting for Borromeo, which is the case for the Louvre painting and is not Jan's standard size.

But in a private communication, James Clifton says that the iconography here is not necessarily that of the Immaculate Conception, which was still under debate in the 1620s (supported by the Jesuits and Franciscans, rejected by the Dominicans). Apocalyptic Woman imagery was applied to the Immaculate Conception but was used in other contexts too.

Here, many items of produce are added into the garland to give a general sense of abundance.</p><p>Diaz Padron also suggests that several documents refer to this painting, and give it a provenance back to Isabella in Brussels who would then have sent it to the Infanta in Spain. He notes that in a letter to Bianchi of April 22, 1611, Jan Brueghel mentions making two versions of a garland painting, one of them for Borromeo and the other for Isabella. However, this seems too early for it to refer to the present painting. On the other hand we do have the following description from the 1623 Spanish Inventory:  ""#I 939  Otra tabla de Nuestra Señora con el Niño en los brazos con un festón de frutas y flores con moldura de ébano que envió  la señora ynfanta de Flandes.”</p>","May 31, 2013"

The painting was inspected in the original in May 2012 by Drs. Fred G. Meijer of the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie in The Hague: Drs. Meijer has noted the excellent quality of, in particular, the irises and the tulips, which he considers too advanced in technique for a copyist and stylistically very similar to other works of the same date by Brueghel to which the panel is related, such as those in Vienna and Prague. From a technical point of view, Drs. Meijer views the very particular degradation of pigments as typical of Jan's flower still lifes from this date as, too, he does the composition which, with the removal of the two extensions at each margin, would see the blooms brought right up to the edge of the picture plane. The visible changes the artist has made to the vase further argue against Ertz's summation. Thus the type of composition, which dates to circa 1605-10, the very high quality of the execution of certain flowers, together with other aforementioned technical elements argue strongly for the authorship of Jan Brueghel the Elder himself in the years prior to 1610, which is to say prior to the arrival in the studio of his son Jan Brueghel the Younger, to whom some scholars had previously attributed the painting. Drs. Meijer has however pointed to several weaker areas of execution, such as the white rose in the centre, which he feels denote the collaboration of an assistant in the studio.  </p><p>Brueghel has replaced the Vienna vase with a wide-bottomed version and removed the coin and ring from the lower right. Every other flower from the Vienna panel is replicated, though in a different position and in many cases with subtle changes of disposition. Brueghel has added a cabbage white and other insects, while removing others. He has elongated the earlier composition in Vienna and used a considerably larger panel (the Vienna panel measures 51 by 40 cm.) so that there is now an explosion of space between each bloom. This is particularly noticeable around the edges and towards the apex of the bouquet. Drs. Meijer has said that such elongation argues for a dating nearer 1610 than 1605.</p><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/old-master-british-paintings-evening-sale/lot.14.html"">http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/old-master-british-p...</a></p>","May 4, 2014"

238,3184,"Stefan Bartilla","<p>This painting corresponds very close to a engraving of Aegidius Sadeler after a design by Roelandt Savery (c. 164 x 220 mm, Illustrated Bartsch, 72/01, p. 22, no. 227 ). Both, print and painting, shows the same direction with light from left below.  The branches and leaves differ in details. The painting could be the original by Savery or a good copy after the print. The engraving belongs to a series of six, done in Prague without dating. The collaboration between Savery and Aegidius Sadeler started in all probability in 1609, but I guess, that this series of print by Sadeler, to which this print belongs, was created few years later, around 1611 or 1612, see Bartilla, Stefan, Roelandt Savery Inventor. In: Kotková, Olga (ed.), Roelandt Savery, Malíř ve službách císaře Rudolfa II. – A Painter in the Services of Emperor Rudolf II, exhibition catalog, Národní galerie v Praze / National Gallery in Prague, Praha 2010, pp. 269-277. The original painting or the original design fits not well in the production of Savery before 1609. In his (probably) second print-series with bohemian wood landscapes from around 1610 he arrives to very expressive figures of trees. The composition of the Forest landscape (Cologne) derives from this achievements. There is very probably also some influence of Jan Brueghel in this design, but the painting is in my opinion surely not by him.</p>","June 22, 2014"

Copy attributed to Jan the Younger in a German private collection (Ertz JBII, cat. #2); Ertz dates this to 1625 when Jan took over father's studio, but if that's true, how did he copy a work dated 1607?  It would be more plausible if that painting were simply an earlier studio version. There are also what Ertz in 1979 considered ""autograph replicas"" and which are actually similarly-structured landscapes with, often, quite different staffage.  Here they are:  in a Belgian private collection (#156) which I have rejected; Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum (#157), an autograph work which has same landscape but with staffage by Vrancx;  Munich, Alte Pinakothek (#158), a somewhat weaker copy with slight variants in staffage; a lost version (#159) that I'm dubious about; and one in a private collection which is my #q160. His 1979 #112 is a related work but not really a ""variant"" of this one. Works Ertz cites in Warsaw and Maastricht as variants by followers are quite distant from original.  There is a mediocre copy in Madrid, Prado, cat. #1885 that Ertz doesn't mention.  Several other quite awful copies also exist, photos at RKD; one was in a private collection in Germany in 1927; another on the art market London (Koetser) in 1965.

The impact of Cornelis van Dalems invention was quite considerable, also on other artists. </p><p>Jan Brueghel could also have seen the two pictures, pendants, painted by Bartholomeus Spranger 1569 in Rome, when he was in service of Cardinal Farnese (both now in Karlsruhe, Kusthalle; Oberhuber, Konrad, Die Landschaft im Frühwerk Bartholomäus Sprangers, in: Jahrbuch der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen in Baden-Württemberg I, 1964, pp. 173-176, fig. 142, 143). In the same year he painted also the landscape frescoes in the Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola (Bert W. Meijer, Bartholomeus Spranger and Michiel de Joncqoquoy in Sant’Oreste, in: Oud Holland, 124/2011, p. 46, note 12). Bartholomeus Spranger studied with Cornelis van Dalem in 1560-1564 (Van Mander, 1604, Levens Ned., fol. 268v-269r). In one of the mentioned paintings from 1569, he copied the cave with the wooden construction of Cornelis van Dalem (Karlsruhe, Kunsthalle, inv. no. 2449). Obviously he made in Antwerp a copy of the original drawing, which was part of his stock, when leaving for Italy.<br />It seems more plausible, that Jan Brueghel saw the Spranger picture and perhaps the copy after the drawing of Cornelis van Dalem in Rome, given the fact, that Jan Brueghel created the Landscape with Cistern in 1595 for the Cardinal Federico Borromeo.<br />The hermit on the Landscape with Cistern (Milan) Jan Brueghel took over from a print by Albrecht Dürer, St. Anthony in front of a City, from 1519 (Meder 51, Panofsky 165).</p>","May 7, 2014"

Yet the borrowing is, formally, very direct, almost an interpretation of De Vos like his slightly later paintings would be interpretations of his father's works. Here, in comparison to the original print, the saint has been moved farther back into the picture space and made smaller, less wild. The cave has shrunk. All the wildlife in the foreground is new.

Luuk Pijl (Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, (Milan 2006), 125-126) now gives the landscapes to Coninxloo. Jones had suggested Vinckboons.

In that work the staffage may be by Vrancx. But for the present work, the other Momper/Brueghel work is a much more logical pairing.

A less settled question is whether the 1605 rametto refers to this picture, for it has been argued that this is the bagatello that Brueghel sent his patron in 1596, shortly after his return to Antwerp (letter of October 10, 1596; Crivelli 7).

414,3422,"E.A. Honig","<p>The injunction to name the animals is not a common subject, but it is depicted in Creation series. An example close to Brueghel is the cycle of paintings by a fellow Netherlander in Italy, Jan Soens. His series divides the events of creation somewhat oddly: Adam appears (apparently somewhat stunned) in the picture usually called God Dividing Light from Dark, while the next scene seems to conflate the quickening of Adam with the injunction to name the animals. Soens’s paintings, now in Parma, are based on a series of prints by Johannes Sadeler after Marten de Vos. See Meijer, Parma e Bruxelles, 56-66. </p><p>I could not see the signature or date in the very clear photograph at the RKD. Animals in this version, at least the lions, are closely related to those in the Paris ""Allegory of Earth"" which I think must date from ca.1605 or so. The horse in the present painting, though, is much more primitive, almost naive. In contrast to his later versions of this theme, where animals are insistently paired, here pairing is uneven. Lots of creatures appear that don't ""belong"" together -- so again, not those semi-taxonomies of later works. </p><p>Re: dating, query if this could be Paradise painting from Giustiniani collection? It was a work on copper listed in 1601 inventory as ""same size"" as a bunch of other Brueghels he owned, ie., the standard Jan size as this one is. This is the only surviving Paradise that meets those criteria (approximate date, size, support).</p><p>Note also that another painting in the Doria Pamphili of God Creating the Animals (inv. 452, panel, 72 x 140) reuses some of the same animals from this painting. Berger, in her book on Bril, accepts that work as being by Bril but suggests that the animals might be by Brueghel. She dates it to before 1600; given its large size it would have to have been done in Rome and I don't believe that they were by Jan back then. The animals lack the liveliness and refinement of his, although of course they are much larger. There are several other related pictures in the Doria Pamphilij which Berger does not accept as Brils (#s 473 & 5381).

To harbor have been added all these figures from just slightly later JB works, like Ertz 13 from 1595--a figure group is directly reproduced from there.  Since Ertz 13 was in the Barberini Collection and hence didn't leave Italy before 20th century, that would mean that either the painter of the Sotheby's picture worked from a drawing by JB, or knew the painting in Rome.  But other figures here, especially woman seated on basket at far left and figures in midground with cart, are I am sure taken from works from school of Beuckelaer, works like Getty picture in fact.

495,3518,"E.A. Honig","<p>Figures here in lower right corner are indeed the same as in a painting by Paul Bril, Harbor at Night with Lighthouse, in Vienna dating from 1601.  Ertz, p.93, says that Jan must have taken his staffage from a drawing by Bril.  He  is known to have copied a drawing by Matthijs Bril.   Some boat in this picture is also copied from Bril.  It's been suggested (Russell 1992) that the present work is by Cornelis Liefrinck II and copies a work by his father Hans II, or is a variant on it.    I've looked at the only known works by Cornelis and I don't believe this is by him.  It's too refined. Bril connection actually ends up backing Pijl/Ertz's argument.  I mean, how could this Leiden Liefrinck guy have known about the Bril drawing or painting?  Russell thinks that Hendrick Vroom somehow made the connection--he knew Bril in ROme in the 1580s.  But she that's even more tenuous than Ertz's idea of a lost drawing that JB could have copied-it relies on both a lost drawing and an uncertain intermediary.  </p><p>Pijl has examined this painting himself and says it is definitely by JB.  The painting Russell says is monogrammed by Hans Liefrinck II has clearly been tampered with to make it into a JB.  Oddly, when it was sold at Christie's NY (22.v.98 #50) it was tentatively attributed to Hans Liefrinck II [or anon. Flemish] but the monogram on it clearly now reads IB.  I have looked closely at catalog illustration, which is very clear, and compared it the present work as illustrated in Ertz 1979. The putative Hans Liefrinck is a clearly inferior work.  Everything about it is less alive, less clever, less detailed--from ship in foreground to very distant background and way light is treated there.  So the putative HL is NOT a JB.  I do not understand its relationship to Ertz #1, which Pijl says IS a JB and I'm inclined to believe him.  I am going, however, to deattribute also the Indiannapolis seascape, or I'm going to put it as a ""q"" number.   God knows who was knocking off Ertz #1, but it wasn't [only] JB himself.</p>","July 18, 2015"

The rocks are clearly related to his very earliest small works on copper (though in reverse). The figures at the shore derive, I am pretty sure, from the work of Joachim Beuckelaer or his followers! Other landscape elements like the trees in midground and distance are all wrong for Jan. The scales of some of the figures are off and their heads and faces are weak.

The first of these must actually refer to the piture by Pieter the Elder in the Vienna collection. Since the present work definitely is in Vienna by 1619 the second of these items could plausibly be a reference to it, yet it would be remarkable if a work that Brueghel painted in Italy (it would have to be a 1595 work) reached the Archduke so fast. My inclination is to date this work closer to 1597 and to think it was acquired for Vienna because of its intriguing similarity to works by Pieter Bruegel in that collection. If this painting was done in Italy, Jan must have had more drawings by his father with him there than we think. The soldiers fighting for the cloak are evidently based on a lost PBI painting that PBII eventually produced versions of (one is in the Church of St. Severin in Paris).

But the latter was certainly not Jan’s invention: the relative scale of the figures, their often hidden faces, and the fascination with commonplace objects and habits are all Pieter the Elder’s manner and uncharacteristic of Jan’s work.</p>","January 23, 2015"

As described by Jan the Younger at his estate sale, Jan had owned a “waterverf doec van mynen grootvader” which was valued at fl.300, higher than any works except for some flower garlands: Denucé, Brieven en documenten, 140. Perhaps this was the “Peasant Fight.” It could also have been his father’s version of the Wedding Procession, which might explain why the quite oblong proportions of this work are so different from Pieter the Elder’s other images of peasant life, and more like his larger watercolor Blind Leading the Blind in Naples.

According to Johnny van Haeften catalogue, following Blankart,  ""The clear message is that no longer are the senses the dangerous deceivers that they were once thought to be, but they are loyal and dedicated servants at the Court of Man.  Man, the all powerful, rules these tamed faculties with temperance, here symbolized by the tiny pair of compasses held in his right hand."" The identification Blankart had made of man at table as ""Man"" is based on a print by A Collaert after Adam van Noort, which shows Man with the senses as his dedicated servants:  he needs only ""temperance"" to govern them.

675,3808,"E.A.

One of the earliest is the Road in a wood of 1605 in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.... also one of the same subject and dated 1607 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, with five autograph versions and variants: one in a Belgian private collection; that in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp (with staffage by Vrancx); two other paintings in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich (one also with staffage by Vrancx); and a painting in the Saulmann collection, Florence. Since Ertz's 1979 publication, two other paintings have come to light depicting paths through woods: the present picture and that exhibited in the 1993-4 Age of Rubens exhibition (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts; and Toledo, Museum of Art, no. 82), also dated 1608.</p><p>That latter work and the present painting are of particular interest, representing as they do the only examples of Jan's paintings of this group - with the 1605 Munich picture - that do not closely derive from that in the Metropolitan Museum. The Boston exhibition picture maintains the secondary vista of the Munich painting, whereas the present work follows the advance of the Metropolitan painting in restricting the perspective to a single vanishing point; the staffage, on the other hand, in some ways recalls more the Munich landscape, notably the foreground wagon with, riding in it, a mother and child, whilst the broken trees and horse's skeleton show the development of the Metropolitan Museum painting....</p><p>This picture was formerly in the remarkable collection of Etienne-François, duc de Choiseul. Two extraordinary visual records make it possible to reconstruct the taste of Choiseul's collection: the 'Choiseul box' (1770-1; Paris, Baron Elie de Rothschild private collection), a gold snuff-box made by Louis Roucel with miniature views by Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe, depicting Choiseul and his friends at his Paris hôtel in the rue de Richelieu, surrounded by his collection; and the 1771 catalogue of the collection by Pierre-François Basan, consisting of 124 engravings of Choiseul's finest pictures and one of the earliest catalogues of a private collection to be copiously illustrated.</p>","November 16, 2013"
676,3809,"E.A. Honig","<p>Copy in Elmira, Arnot Art Museum, on copper, 25 x 34, which Ertz mysteriously attributes to Jan and an unknown Flemish painter from around 1605. In the copy, the child who strangely accompanyies the leftmost nymph in the present work is not there. Ertz dates the present work and the Elmira version bizarrely early, like before Jan went to Italy, which is plainly impossible.  Clearly De Backer cannot have collaborated with Brueghel while the latter was in Italy, though; there is no record that De Backer ever was there.  It's unlikely, but not as far as I know impossible, that they could have collaborated after Jan came back to Antwerp. De Backer seems to have died in France around 1600, so was he already there when Jan returned? At the RKD the present work is filed under Hendrik de Clerck, which would solve the dating problem. It doesn't seem good enough to be him, and yet I feel that it's closer to him than to any other figure painter. The quality of this work is mixed, with very nice parts and very bad ones.  The nymphs in the background are awkward, poorly drawn, and don't connect spatially to the ones in the foreground (who are very nicely done).  It's hard to say about the attribution of the foreground and landscape but it doesn't scream ""early work"" to me.  In fact the dog reminds me of things that come a little later in Jan's career.  The two dead rabbits at the lower left are poorly done and make me doubt the whole thing. I would reject both this and the copy.  There is something really wrong with the space, as there never is in a real Brueghel.  There needed to be a greater distance constructed between the foreground and background figures and the landscape painter failed to do this.  And there is no way that the first paintings of Jan have this kind of stagey foreground with dead game and hunting dogs; it's just wrong. Possibly more research into the process by which the painting was made could help us to understand these discrepancies.</p>","July 24, 2013"

714,3845,"E.A. Honig","<p>This is one of those basic pattern pieces that gets copied and altered many many times. The following notes are based on Ertz 1979.<br />A variant not mentioned by Ertz (and a very bad one, too) formerly in the Dragor collection, Denmark, col. G. Sadolin [RKD JB L1].  Two more unmentioned but OK variants are:  formerly art market, Paris (Charpentier, 12.v.48 #27, panel, 20 X 30.5) and formerly art market, Paris (Galliera 20.vi.61 #66, copper, 21 x 22).  Variants Ertz does list are his #106 in Toledo from 1604 (see below) and his #95 in Turin dated perhaps 1603 which isn't really a variant.  Then there are three more possibilities--ones he doubts attribution of but could be studio variants:  his #141 is indeed a quite close take-off of this Wellington painting, while the other two he doesn't illustrate.  There are also two works he identifies as variants by ""followers"", one in Amsterdam and other in a private collection.  The Amsterdam one is now identified by Ertz as a Jan the Younger (Ertz JBII #31:  copper, 14.5 x 20.5; RKD BL1 as JBI) supposedly done before Jan the Younger left for Italy.   One of these copies was sold Sotheby's London December 5 2007 as being by a follower/studio of JB, with its pendant Ertz #152, also on copper and dated 1607.  This is exactly the sort of work that could be by the studio.  It really isn't a copy at all of the Wellington picture but a quite bad pastich-y variant. </p><p>Condition: small areas of damage upper right and left, otherwise good (from collection catalog). I have changed measurements from Ertz's to match those given by the Wellington museum itself. They also note that the last 2 digits of the date are not easy to discern.</p>","May 18, 2012"

There's some wierd streaking of surface that isn't like Jan, and figures don't have his usual verge.<br />When this was sold at Christie's in 1976 the catalog listed it as being on copper: which is it?<br />Copy Goteborg, Konstmuseet; parts of background borrowed by a follower in Forest Landscape in Leipzig, Museum der Bildenden Kunste; copy of same size but on panel (note this trend!) sold London (Christie's 5.ii.88 #132).

718,3850,"E.A. Honig","<p>Pijl has suggested that this was an original Colonna commission and was a pendant to the Wide River Landscape with Resting Travellers that was Ertz 1979 #4. I don't see why they should be ""pendants"": like Borromeo, the Colonnas were clearly buying up a lot of Brueghels of identical size and support. It is moreover not clear that these were original commissions of theirs -- why were certain works kept forever and others sold off? There is also a painting by Bril dated 1594 that shares a provenance with this and Ertz 4: it is also on copper, 18 x 23.5 (so smaller than the Brueghels). It was in the Cologne/Antwerp exhibition of 1992; in the Cologne catalogue it was #23.1.</p><p>A loose copy of this painting was in the Gemäldegalerie, Vienna, #984 (panel, 70.5 x 97 cm).

719,3851,"E.A. Honig","<p>Ertz dates this work to the 1590s on grounds of technique. I think it is later than his dating: it is certainly very different from the 1594 New Haven painting and closer to the 1604 version in Dresden -- the background is essentially identical. The use of the Temple of Sibylla Tiburtina in the background is typical for works from his early period, like the Rest on the Flight with Rottenhammer, but he also uses it in 1604 painting.  The monsters are all different from either the Dresden or New Haven versions.  There is a drawing related to this painting in Hamburg.</p><p>Description in 1801 Bosschaert catalogue: Une Grotte dans laquelle l’on voit St Antoine; derrière lui sont trois diables transformés en jolies filles et d’autres spectres, trop à en faire mention; plus loin on découvre des bâtimens en feu; le reste offer un Paysage d’une touché delicate et où l’en découvre un clair de lune, c’est sans exagérer le plus fini et le plus beau morceau qui peut paroître de Breugel”, on copper and 8 x 11 ½ [pouces d’Anvers] = 20.8 x 29.9 cm).</p>","March 18, 2014"
720,3853,"E.A. Honig","<p>Has been attributed to both Coninxloo and Jan Brueghel.

721,3854,"E.A. Honig","<p>Ertz argues strongly that this is a second-rate work (""mittelmassigen Qualitat""), the product of Jan the Younger and Rubens's studio. Nobody else has agreed with him on this. If he were right, the painting would be much later than all other scholars date it, by at least a decade. According to Mulders, the painting was done for Albrecht and Isabella, and the composition was initiated by Rubens with Brueghel doing his parts afterwards.</p><p>Theme is from Ovid, Metamorphoses, VIII.

744,5550,"E.A. Honig","<p>From the Dorotheum's online auction details:</p><blockquote><p>We are grateful to Klaus Ertz for confirming the attribution after examination of the painting in the original (written communication, March 2015).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz writes: “The present painting can be said to have survived in good condition. The paints, applied in the impasto technique, still give a jewel-like and brilliant impression, while the overlapping, translucent glazes are excellently preserved. The copper plate is one of the thick and heavy types produced in the early 17th century […]. When compared to the ‘world landscapes’ of the 16th century, the approach to reality in the present picture has fundamentally changed. Different from the art of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, for example, here the beholder no longer looks down on a scene set far below, but metaphorically speaking almost enters the picture’s space. Nevertheless Jan Brueghel the Elder maintains the distance between the spectator and the composition by still choosing a slightly raised vantage point. At the same time, the artist ‘narrates’ episodes from contemporary everyday village life, such as the conversation between villagers, animals moving about freely, figures attending to horses, and the loading and unloading of barges. These ‘story-telling’ village landscapes number among the artist’s most advanced and pioneering compositions, which he started tackling around 1605. They can generally be assigned to the genre of ‘village scenes by a river’, which involves the peculiar combination of two themes of landscape painting that also existed individually: the village landscape and the river landscape. In this painting, the 16th century’s rigid division into the three colours of brown, green, and blue has been entirely overcome. Spatial depth is now merely accentuated by zones of light and shade and, of course, by the canal, which orthogonally extends into the background. Foreground, midground, and background seamlessly blend into one another.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz compares the present painting to the following works by Jan Brueghel I, all of which are closely related to it in terms of composition and painterly handling:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Village Scene with a Forge (Pushkin Museum, Moscow, signed and dated 1603);<br />2. Village Road (Alte Pinakothek, Munich, signed and dated 1610);<br />3. Village Landscape with a Canal (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan, signed and dated 16.7);<br />4. Village Road with a Canal (private collection, signed and dated 1609)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz continues: “Like the present painting, the works by Jan Brueghel the Elder mentioned above belong to the landscape type of ‘wide river landscape’. The beholder’s eye wanders across the picture and its spatiality as a whole without ‘getting stuck’. Horizontals dominate over verticals, although the row of houses on the right-hand side still betrays vertical tendencies, which would play a role in the painter’s work throughout his career as a formal and compositional means to organise the two-dimensional surface of the picture. In terms of chronology, the painting to be assessed here must be assigned to approximately the period in which the comparative examples mentioned above were made. Given the development of Flemish landscape painting in general and the similarities between the aforementioned compositions and the present painting in particular, the latter seems to date from the mid-1610s.”</p></blockquote>","October 10, 2015"

763,18655,"E.A. Honig","<p>In a forthcoming article, Larry Silver will argue that this painting draws inspiration from his father's models and provide further evidence for probable sources to Pieter's work. </p><p>Similarities to the Jan Brueghel the Elder Crucifixion in Vienna support our opinion that this painting is genuine. The group in the foreground is identical: servants are fighting over Christ’s cloak. The two guards in red and blue are standing in the same position, while a cavalier carrying a heavy basket on his back is watching the three men fighting on the ground. in the background, melting into the blue, we can perceive a fortress resembling a citadel, representing Jerusalem: it is on the right in the copper in Vienna and on the left in ours. The only real difference in the narration of the episode is that in this version, the three crosses are fixed in place, whereas in the Viennese version, the left-hand cross for the thief is in the process of being erected.</p><p>An important difference is the figures at the lower left corner who seem to represent the souls in limbo awaiting Christ’s resurrection so that they can be freed to go to heaven. This is a very unusual element in a crucifixion scene, which Larry Silver’s forthcoming article will investigate.</p>","October 2, 2018"
