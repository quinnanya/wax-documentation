"bio1","Lucas van Uden","Lucas","Van Uden","1595–1672","<p>The son of the town painter, Artus van Uden, Lucas joined Antwerp’s Guild of St. Luke as a “master’s son” in 1626-27. His grandfather was Pieter van Uden, the founder of a well-known tapestry workshop in Antwerp. Lucas was likely trained by his father and was heavily influenced throughout his career by recent developments in Flemish landscape painting. He spent most of his career in Antwerp where he lived with his wife Anna van Woelput, whom he married in 1627. </p><p>Lucas van Uden is best-known for his etchings and watercolors, which demonstrate his great talent for observing nature. His biographer wrote that he often took walks into the countryside early in the morning to make landscape sketches, though this might not be the truth, as most of his paintings follow a specific formula. Van Uden’s careful attention to detail in his smaller paintings and his use of decorative elements in his larger paintings place him in the same tradition as Jan Breughel. He was heavily influenced by Rubens as well, and made copies of many of his works. Lucas used many of Ruben’s favorite figures in his own compositions, like cows at a watering hole or a woman carrying a round jug on her head, and adapted stylistic choices like lighting and color from Rubens as well. Because he borrowed so many motifs from Rubens, many believed for a while that Lucas van Uden had been his assistant. However, this was not the case. </p>","Rigby Philips",,"painter",48,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio1/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio1/fullwidth.jpg"

"bio13","Gerard De Jode","Gerard de","De Jode","1511-1591","<p>Cartographer and engraver Gerard De Jode was born 1509 in Nijmegen in the province of Gelderland. Though not much is known about his early life, by 1547 he had relocated to Antwerp. Once there, he was admitted as a master into the Guild of St. Luke, and he became a citizen of the city in 1549. Two years later, in 1551, he received an official license to print and publish his works. Among these were a number of map books, some illustrated by De Jode himself and others done in collaboration with fellow artists. His most famous work is Speculum orbis terrarum (1578), a comprehensive reissue of his previous maps. The book was continuously updated after De Jode’s death in 1591 by his eldest son, Cornelis De Jode. Though it was not commercially successful during De Jode’s lifetime, the book has grown to be his m0st enduring work.</p><p>As one of northern Europe’s most successful publishers, De Jode often came in contact with the Netherlandish art world. He often published prints after designs byMarten de Vos, Crispin van den Broeck, Hendrick Goltzius, and other leading artists. De Jode also had a close connection with the Brueghel family of artists that extended beyond the professional. His son, Pieter De Jode, frequently made prints after designs by Jan Brueghel the Elder. And De Jode’s daughter, Isabella De Jode, married Jan in 1599. Though this was nearly a decade after De Jode’s death, the marriage and the couple’s two children united both families for generations.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago","publisher","publisher",16,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio13/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio13/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio14","Pieter Brueghel the Younger","Pieter","Brueghel the Younger","1564–1638","<p>Pieter Brueghel the Younger was born in Brussels in 1564, the eldest son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Mayken Coecke van Aelst. Although his father died in 1569, the younger Pieter’s career would be deeply impacted by his famous father.</p><p>Brueghel’s mother died when he was a young teenager, and he and his siblings were raised by her sisters. He moved to Antwerp in 1583, where he became an apprentice to Gillis van Coninxloo. Two years later, at the age of 21, he registered as a master and an independent artist with the Guild of St. Luke. He married Elisabeth Godelet on November 5, 1588. The couple had seven children, and at least one of their sons, Pieter III, would go on to become an artist. Brueghel took his son on as an apprentice, as well as seven other students between 1588 and 1626. His artistic career was often dictated by the legacy of his famous father and the influence of his more innovative younger brother, Jan Brueghel the Elder. Pieter was never very financially successful, despite a prolific output. Nevertheless, he managed to have a significant impact on the Flemish art market with his replicas of his father’s works and personal compositions inspired by the traditional Brueghel style. He died on October 10, 1636 at 73, having cemented alongside his brother the Brueghel legacy his father left behind.</p><p>Brueghel’s artistic output drew heavily from common Brueghel motifs, both in the form of direct replications of his father’s compositions and also his own original and successful works. These are primarily genre and landscape scenes that highlight his accomplishments as a nature and background painter. Brueghel also collaborated with other painters. Due to his family’s significance in the Flemish art world, he had many connections and access to the other preeminent artists of his day. Among his collaborators are Gillis Mostaert, Franchois de Grooten, and Frans Snyders, who was one of his students.</p><p>Brueghel is most famous for his replicas and reworkings of his father’s paintings. At the time of his death, Pieter the Elder had revolutionized the Flemish art world. Though his father died when he was only a young child, Pieter would have likely been exposed to his works and methods through past students and patrons. The younger Brueghel also worked in a much different economic context than his father, one in which Flemish art dealers prioritized familiar and previously successful styles. As he matured in this environment, Brueghel adopted his father’s technique as his own, and many of the works he produced were direct copies of his father’s most famous paintings. Among these are Winter Landscape with Skaters and a Bird-trap, St John the Baptist Preaching, and Netherlandish Proverbs. Brueghel and his studio made dozens of these works in the highly sought-after Brueghel style and sold them through dealers. Often, Brueghel tweaked his father’s compositions so that they better fit certain art markets. This practice ranged from omitting weather patterns to completely rearranging the composition of figures. His replicas were highly diverse in their subject matter, ranging between religious, secular, and moralizing themes. Though Brueghel never distinguished himself as an individual artist, his enterprise allowed him to capitalize on his family’s legacy and to magnify the renown of the Brueghel name.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago","relative","painter",5,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio14/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio14/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio15","Hendrick van Balen","Hendrick","Van Balen","1575–1632","<p>Hendrick van Balen was born in 1575 to the merchant Willem van Balen and Mechtelt van Aelten. A resident of Antwerp for most of his life, he became a master (Freimeister) in the city’s Guild of St. Luke (1592/3) before embarking on a trip to Italy. During his time there, he either met or studied the works of Hans Rottenhammer, and he was also heavily influenced by the work of Tintoretto. In 1609, back in Antwerp, he was named deacon of the painters’ guild. He was also constantly praised as liefhebber, a term describing a painter or lay patron who demonstrated acute and learned appreciation of contemporary art. For example, Van Balen received this accolade together with Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder for procuring a work painted by Caravaggio. Van Balen was intimately connected to Rubens and Brueghel in both professional and social capacities: they collaborated on paintings and shared drawings, and public records attest to their mutual appointments as godparents as well as intermarriage in the next generation. Van Balen regularly worked alongside contemporaries outside of this trio, including Anthony van Dyck, one of his many pupils. He married the middle-class Margareta Briers (1604) and fathered eleven children, three of whom—Jaspar, Hendrick the Younger, and Jan, the most successful—became painters. He died on July 17, 1632.</p><p>Of a total 219 works attributed to Van Balen by Bettina Werche, 76 are either confidently or tentatively identified as collaborations with Jan Brueghel the Elder. Their earliest work together—“The Judgment of Paris” (Berlin) —was painted in 1600. Van Balen’s oeuvre, as described by Werche, spans three periods and several genres. The first period starts with his ascension as Freimeister and covers his early works through 1608. Van Balen absorbed the late Mannerist tendencies of Italian art in the 1590s, yet the works produced after his return to Antwerp demonstrate a reinvigorated Flemish influence on his figuration. The second period of 1609–25 involves the radical adoption of Rubens’ style as well as its subversion, particularly through his characteristically small format. Finally, the third period of 1625–32 is bounded by the deaths of Brueghel and Van Balen. At this time Van Balen concentrated more on central, plot-driven scenes by painting fewer and larger figures. The productive cooperation between the Brueghel and Van Balen families continued in this period with Jan Breughel the Younger’s contributions to about 50 works, although Hendrick’s son Jan van Balen would sever the connection upon his father’s death.</p><p>Van Balen painted altars, designed stained glass windows, and engaged with the copper plate as a medium, but he is best known for his myriad cabinet paintings (Kabinettbilder). Through most of his career, he painted heavily populated scenes related to mythology, allegory, and biblical history with a preference for nude female mythical figures and personifications. In the realm of religious iconography, Van Balen contributed to the development of the floral wreath (Blumenkränzen) type of Madonna and Child depiction.</p>","Ashley Gonik","collaborator","painter",42,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio15/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio15/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio16","Abraham Ortelius","Abraham","Ortelius","1527–1598","<p>Abraham Ortelius, sixteenth century cartographer and geographer, was orphaned at the age of twelve and was raised by his uncle, Jacob van Meteren, in Antwerp. While later in life his craft drew him to various important European cities, it was during Ortelius’ time in Antwerp as an apprentice to a map engraver that he established relationships with the artists he later patronized. In 1547 he joined the artists’ Guild of St. Luke, through which he connected with Marten de Vos, Joris Hoefnagel, Lucas d’Heere, Frans Hogenberg, Philips Galle, and Pieter Bruegel.</p><p>Ortelius’ close friendship with Bruegel is attested perhaps most clearly by two artifacts created after the artist’s death in 1569: an epitaph, and an engraving. The former, written around 1573 in Ortelius’ Album Amicorum, conveys both his personal relationship with Bruegel, and his opinion of Bruegel as “the most perfect painter of the century.” Ortelius furthered the secondary purpose of the epitaph—to commemorate Bruegel’s artistic brilliance—by commissioning an engraving from Philips Galle of a grisaille Bruegel had painted for Ortelius in 1564. He sent copies of this engraving to Dirck Volckertsz Coornhert and Benedictus Arias Montanus, the latter of whom quickly recognized the print as a version of the very grisaille--Bruegel’s The Death of the Virgin. Though little is known about the circumstances in which Bruegel painted this grisaille for Ortelius, their close friendship seems a likely explanation. The year after Bruegel’s death, 1570, Ortelius published what became his best-known work Theatrum Orbis Terrarum: a compendium of maps from various sources created with the purpose of expanding the human understanding of world geography. Ortelius died in 1598 in Antwerp.</p>","Cecily Manson","patron","scholar",32,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio16/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio16/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio17","Jan Noirot","Jan","Noirot",,"<p>Jan Noirot, at one time the Master of the Antwerp Mint, declared bankruptcy and abandoned his wife and nine children in 1572. A forced auction was held on September 15th of that year to pay off his debt. The record of this auction reveals that Noirot owned around fifty paintings, five of which were painted by Pieter Bruegel. His art collection displays his interest in peasant revels, particularly clear in his selection of Bruegel works: one winter landscape, two peasant weddings, and two peasant kermis scenes. In his home, which itself was owned by the Antwerp Mint, the Bruegel paintings were divided among two rooms. Two peasant weddings, a peasant kermis, and the winter landscape were hung alongside family portraits and a painting of the Virgin Mary in a small back chamber adjoining the main dining room. The second peasant kermis was displayed next to a peasant wedding attributed to Hieronymous Bosch in an upper chamber of his home. A peasant wedding and peasant kermis, both recorded as painted in oils, are two of Noirot’s most expensive possessions; they cost 80 and 42 guilders respectively. Their price reflects the opulence of the oil medium. The other three paintings cost between 27-28 guilders presumably because they were painted in water-based tempera. Four of the paintings were painted on cloth (op doeck), while the fifth and most costly was painted on an undesignated support. As these paintings were auctioned only three years after Bruegel’s death in 1569, there is little dispute that they are Bruegel’s own.</p>","Cecily Manson",,"merchant/professional",31,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio17/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio17/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio18","Nicolaes Jongelinck","Nicolaes","Jongelinck","1517-1570","<p>Nicolaes Jongelinck was a prominent Antwerp merchant and patron of both Pieter Bruegel and Frans Floris. A member of an affluent Antwerp family with many ties to the Mint, it is possible that Jongelinck could have known another Bruegel patron and officed Mint member, Jan Noirot. Like many wealthy figures of the early modern period, Jongelinck owned both a metropolitan home, De Sphera Mundi in the Kidorpstraat, and a leisure home just outside the city gates. For his suburban villa, Ter Beke, Jongelinck commissioned works from Floris and Bruegel. As Ter Beke was destroyed in Alessandro Farnese’s siege of Antwerp in 1584, the placement of the paintings within the villa is not known. Floris’s Hercules and Liberal Arts may have had their own viewing chambers within the home, and Bruegel’s Twelve Months were likely the dining room décor. In 1565, Jongelinck pledged his Bruegel collection (or a portion of it) as security for Daniel de Bruyne, who owed 16,000 guilders to the city of Antwerp. The record of this pledge confirms Jongelinck’s ownership of at least sixteen Bruegel pieces at this time, including the recently completed Twelve Months series, a Tower of Babel and Christ Carrying the Cross. After his death in 1570, Jongelinck’s Bruegel collection was sold, resurfacing in 1593 in the hands of Archduke Ernst, then governor of Netherlands. An inventory of the Archduke’s paintings indicates that at this juncture there were six paintings in the Twelve Month series, of which only five are known to remain.</p>","Cecily Manson","patron","merchant/professional",28,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio18/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio18/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio19","Cardinal Granvelle","Cardinal","Granvelle","1517–1586","<p>Cardinal Granvelle, born Anthony Perrenot, was perhaps Bruegel’s most eminent patron. Born in 1517 in Besancon, Granvelle became the focus of his doting father, a chancellor under Emperor Charles V. His father’s political ambitions included the advancement of his son’s career, and due to this forceful backing, young Granvelle was educated and treated as a rising statesman. He studied at the University of Padua and was appointed the apostolical protonotary by Clement VII at the age of fourteen. Later he became the chief minister to Margaret of Parma, the regent of the Low Countries, and in 1561 he was appointed cardinal and archbishop of Mechelen. It was Granvelle’s political office in the Low Countries at this time that allowed him to make the acquaintance of Pieter Bruegel. In his palace in Brussels-- a structure that was continually enlarged to match the growth of his extensive art collection—was the studio of Jacques Jonghelinck, sculptor and brother of Bruegel’s patron, Niclaes Jonghelinck. In 1563, Granvelle acquired The Flight into Egypt, very likely through direct purchase from Bruegel. Due to religious and political tensions, however, Granvelle was forced to leave the Low Countries the following year. He died in September 1586 in Madrid, and his remains were placed in a mausoleum in the city of his birth.</p>","Cecily Manson","patron","cardinal/prelate",26,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio19/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio19/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio2","Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia","Infanta","Isabella Clara Eugenia","1566–1633","<p>Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia was the most prominent female patron of Jan Brueghel. The infanta was born on August 12, 1566 into the powerful Habsburg family. She was the eldest daughter of King Philip II and his third wife Elisabeth de Valois, who died just two years after Isabella’s birth. Subsequently, Isabella and her sister Catalina Micaela (one year her junior) were left in the care of Doña Johanna de Jacincourt, the mistress of the robes and in the latter half of Isabella’s life, her close friend. Though little is known about Isabella’s court education, she was reputed to be an adept horseman, skilled with an arquebus, and fluent in Portuguese, all of which skills endeared her to her father.</p><p>As the first-born child of King Philip II, Isabella was entitled to rule the Low Countries, but succession laws required that she take on a male consort before claiming her sovereign position. On April 18, 1599, Isabella was married to her cousin Archduke Albert of Austria with whom she ruled over the Habsburg Netherlands for more than twenty years. Had they had a child, he or she would have become sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands, but they did not. Nonetheless, the two decades of their joint rule were a momentous period characterized by their involvement in Spain’s response to the Dutch Revolt and by their formative patronage of baroque masters Jan Brueghel, and his longtime collaborative partner and friend, Peter Paul Rubens. </p><p>In fact, one of the most recognizable images of Isabella is the product of collaboration between Brueghel and Rubens; Infanta Isabella Before Mariemont Castle, was a joint project completed ca. 1615-18 during the most productive period of their collaborative career. As in most of their collaborations, Rubens was responsible for the human subject, Isabella herself, while Brueghel painted the landscape. Brueghel included in the background Mariemont Castle, one of the couple’s smaller homes but particularly beloved by the Infanta. Independently, Brueghel painted a number of scenes in which the couple interact with the Flemish peasantry, for example the Peasant Wedding Banquet with the Archdukes. These pieces have intrigued scholars for their portrayal of the sovereign figures on an intimate basis with the common population. They represented, for the rulers, a sense of mutual love between themselves and the people who worked their land.</p><p>In 1621, upon the death of her husband for whom she would later commission from Rubens the Saint Ildefonso “Altarpiece,” Isabella joined the Third Order of St. Francis as a nun. Although she wished to retire to the Convent of Poor Clares in Madrid, at the insistence of her nephew Philip IV she was reappointed to the position of Governor of the Netherlands. She held this office until her death on December 1, 1633. </p><p>So favored was she in popular memory that King Louis XIII of France wished to beatify her. Then her fame dwindled. Nearly three centuries later, in 1912, Countess Marie Hennequin de Villermont, a painter, writer, and proponent of feminist thought in the Belgian court, published the first biography of Isabella Clara Eugenia, two-volumes in length. </p>","Cecily Manson","patron","ruler/noble",27,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio2/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio2/fullwidth.jpg"

In 1539, he married Cornelia Symons despite the protests of his parents due to her age, lack of means, and the reputation of her sister as the mistress of count Reinoud III of Brederode according to Henk Bonger. Coornhert and his wife then moved to Haarlem, and Coornhert was soon employed by Brederode at the Batestein castle as a steward. His time at Batestein importantly affected his spiritual development as the court was quite anti-Catholic, and it was here that Coornhert first encountered the works of reformers such as Luther and Calvin.</p><p>In 1546, Coornhert moved back to Haarlem, where he worked on etchings and engravings for Maarten van Heemskerck. Coornhert also found time to write, finishing his first play the Comedie vande Rycke man [Comedy of the Rich Man] in 1550, which hints at his early religious beliefs regarding predestination, original sin and perfectability. He also wrote a treatise about the significance of ceremonies Verschoning van de Roomsche afoderije [Apology for Roman Catholic Heresy], which “made Coornhert’s ideas known abroad for the first time” (Bonger 22).</p><p>In 1561, Coornhert opened a printing office in Haarlem, which took the name Van Zuren, and Coornhert’s translation of Cicero’s De officiis was one of its first publications. Coornhert continued to translate ancient works of Seneca and Homer, making Haarlem into a thriving center for the Renaissance. Coornhert’s friends included the celebrated geographer Abraham Ortelius, who was a friend of Pieter Bruegel. Since Coornhert worked for Hieronymus Cock in the 1550s when he moved to Antwerp, as did Bruegel during that time, it is generally supposed that the two artists were acquainted. Some writers have argued that Bruegel shared Coornhert’s religious views. Certainly, he praised Bruegel’s work in a letter to Ortelius after receiving “an engraving by Philips Galle based on Bruegel’s Death of The Virgin” in 1578 (Bonger 28).</p><p>Coornhert became secretary for the government in Haarlem, traveling on business for the city and for Prince William of Orange. As a result of political and religious turmoil, Coornhert fled Haarlem three times into exile, finally returning in 1576. Coornhert then engaged in a series of private and public debates on various theological subjects. Meanwhile, Coornhert continued writing, and after a brief stay in Emdem, Coornhert wrote his most famous book Zedekunst [Ethics] in 1585. Finally at the age of sixty-eight, Coornhert passed away in Haarlem. </p>","Kelsey Schiedermayer",,"scholar",52,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio20/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio20/fullwidth.jpg"

Regarded by contemporaries as a polymath and purveyor of intellectual and artistic advancements, the painter, sculptor, and designer of woodcuts, tapestries and stained glass was credited as one of the first to bring to the North the ideals of the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>Van Aelst’s wives provided two of his most profound links in the artistic community. His first wife was the daughter of the painter Jan Mertens, who may have been Van Aelst’s teacher. Mayken Verhulst, his second wife and Pieter Bruegel’s mother-in-law, has been credited with teaching Bruegel the technique of painting with tempera on cloth. In his biography of Van Aelst, Karel van Mander named him as the Bruegel’s principal teacher and this was long accepted as true, but consideration of stylistic disparity has lead some recent scholars to reject that claim. Additionally, this hypothesis lacks material substantiation as Bruegel is not recorded in Van Aelst’s list of apprentices in the Guild of Saint Luke.</p><p>In 1533-34, Van Aelst travelled to Constantinople. In 1546 he moved from Antwerp to Brussels and was appointed court painter to Emperor Charles the V a few years later. He died on December 6, 1550, the same year he received this official title.

He and his brother Matthys were sons of the painter Jan de Cock who is recorded as having accepted pupils in 1506 and 1516. Matthys was the elder given that he accepted a pupil in 1540, six years before Cock was received as a master in the guild. The date given by Van Mander for Cock’s death, 1570, is confirmed by a document published by Rombouts and Van Lerius. According this this source, he died on October 3rd and was buried in the Predikherenkerk in Antwerp.</p><p>Presumably Cock was trained as a painter in his father’s shop and, after his father’s death, that of his brother. He was received into the guild as a painter, but we know no paintings by his hand. He was the designer of sixty-two etchings, however, and is even more famous as the proprietor of the printing house as of 1550 known as “The Four Winds.”</p><p>Indeed, examination of Cock’s prints suggests that even this aspect of his artistic output was subordinate to the needs of his publishing business. Of the sixty-two etchings which he produced beginning in 1548, forty date from the years 1550-51 when his business was just beginning. The remaining appeared at the rate of one or two a year until 1558, when the set “Landscapes with Biblical and Mythological Scenes” closed Cock’s career as an etcher. As a publisher, Cock’s responsibility was to bear the business’s financial risks and political and social accountability. In doing so successfully, Cock became immensely wealthy, purchasing one house after another.</p><p>Van Mander praised Cock as being himself an inventive landscapist. Landscape was also the first field in which he published the designs of Pieter Bruegel. In 1554, Pieter Bruegel’s landscape drawing (without figures) was adapted by Cock for an etched narrative, “Landscape with the Temptation of Christ.” Between 1555 and 1557, Cock produced a series of landscapes after Bruegel designs, the so-called “Large Landscapes.” Most of these were based on drawings Bruegel had made of mountainous landscapes during his trip to Italy.</p><p>During the 1550’s Bruegel made a variety of designs for Cock. These included religious and allegorical subjects (the famous Seven Virtues and Seven Vices series) and subjects pertaining to human folly and proverbial wisdom. Bruegel’s prints for Cock often partake of the satirical vernacular verbal structures of urban Antwerp. </p>","Ashley Jerbic",,"painter",9,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio22/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio22/fullwidth.jpg"

In around 1516, Clovio moved to Italy, a crucial step in launching his artistic career. He first worked in Venice, serving the Cardinal Domenico Grimani. Under Grimani’s patronage, Clovio had the opportunity to go to Rome, and it was there that he met fellow painter Giulio Romano and was exposed to other great artists of the time.</p><p>Clovio’s works marry monumental figures to a miniature scale and incorporate the level of detail usually associated with northern artists. Clovio was specifically influenced by the works of Michelangelo and Albrecht Dürer. Clovio served King Louis II and Queen Maria of Hungary, and then Cardinal Campeggio until the sack of Rome in 1527. After being taken prisoner by the troops of Charles V, Clovio escaped and fled to Padua to become a Benedictine having, according to Vasari, vowed to join a monastery if God would deliver him from the Spaniards. Clovio briefly returned to the service of Cardinal Grimani, but in 1540, he began to work for his final patron, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. While serving Cardinal Farnese, Clovio produced what is held by many to be his great masterpiece, Farnese Hours (1546).</p><p>In 1553, Clovio briefly returned to Rome where he met Pieter Breugel. The two are thought to have collaborated on the Towneley Lectionary. Clovio returned to Florence, working under the patronage of Cardinal Farnese until Clovio’s death in 1578. Known for his miniatures, Giulio Clovio was a brilliant painter, who, according to Vasari, produced in his paintings some of the “greatest things that mortal hand could do or mortal eye could behold” (Vasari 249).

Eventually, he adopted the pseudonym Hieronymus Bosch, probably referring to his home town of ‘s-Hertogenbosch or Den Bosch.</p><p>In 1488, he became a sworn member of the Brotherhood of Our Lady, a religious organization in 's-Hertogenbosch. His membership proved pivotal to his artistic career, as his first commissions came from the Brotherhood. He would go on to secure a number of other commissions through his connections with the Brotherhood and would become a leading artist in the region. He died and was buried in 1516 in the same town where he was born. His art had a strong impact on his contemporaries and on the generations of artists that followed.</p><p>Bosch’s interpretation or representation of religion appears very different from that of his contemporaries. Indeed, his distinct perspective played a significant role in the endurance of his art into modern times. Bosch viewed mankind with a pessimistic eye and evidently believed that most humans could not be saved. As a result, his works are often moralizing and he is well-known for his damning depictions of vice and sin, which were meant to reflect the folly of humanity’s inherently excessive and impulsive nature. He also occasionally moved away from explicitly Christian scenes, opting instead for secular yet still moralizing subjects. Bosch was especially interested in condemning what he considered to be base social actions. Some of his beliefs were inspired by Christian doctrine, such as his criticism of gluttony and greed. But he also critiqued habits more common in daily Netherlandish life, such as laziness, drunkenness, and lawlessness. He was especially critical of lust and sexuality, which he depicted as the culmination of mankind’s inclination towards indulgence of bodily pleasures.</p><p>Bosch’s formal and iconographical techniques also distinguish him from other sixteenth-century artists. He reworked traditional, even vernacular symbols to express religious and ethical views. He populated his paintings with invented symbolic characters meant to represent some virtue or vice of daily life. He used criminals, low-class workers, and prostitutes to represent the moral failings of humanity, but he also included figures of virtue to contrast with these. He favored hermit saints, whose ascetic lifestyle was something to be praised. Bosch is also well-known for his fantastical creatures and his outlandish depictions of Hell. However, even these images are a result of his moral attitudes. His work is especially characterized by eschatological thinking.</p><p>Bosch left a significant impact on the Netherlandish art world and was influential to artists like Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Bruegel was born about a decade after Bosch’s death and was exposed to Bosch’s style and themes early in his artistic career. This is especially evident in his early engravings, in which he imitated Bosch’s methods of invention, particularly his signifying fantastical creatures. He was also inspired by Bosch’s religious themes. The impact of Bosch’s secular art can also be found in Bruegel’s genre imagery. Like Bosch, Bruegel populated his art with common people and scenes of their everyday lives. Bosch also influenced Bruegel’s son, Jan Brueghel the Elder, and his artwork. Though the younger Brueghel operated in a vastly different art market than his predecessors, one now dominated by wealthy collectors, he still employed many of Bosch’s distinctive techniques. This includes Bosch’s peculiar depictions of Hell and its weird creatures, often reimagined in a Classical context for Brueghel’s elite audience.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago",,"painter",2,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio24/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio24/fullwidth.jpg"

"bio27","Francesco Maria del Monte","Francesco Maria","Del Monte","1549–1627","<p>Francesco Maria del Monte was an Italian cardinal, diplomat, art collector, and patron. Born in Venice in 1549, del Monte was the son Marquis Ranieri Bourbon del Monte and Minerva Pianosa. He came from a noble family from Pesaro with distant relations to the French royal House of Bourbon. Young Francesco Maria was educated at the court of Urbino and obtained a doctorate in law before beginning an ecclesiastical career as the Abbott commendatario of Santa Croce a Monte Fabali. In 1570, at the age of 21, Francesco moved to Rome. For the next decade, he worked in the courts of several Roman cardinals before arriving at the court of Cardinal Ferdinando de Medici in 1581. He was in his service until Medici resigned as cardinal to assume the position of Grand Duke of Tuscany. With Medici’s recommendation, Pope Sixtus V appointed Francesco as cardinal in 1588. Francesco took up residence in the Palazzo Madama, owned by Medici, in 1589. He served from 1606 to 1616 as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, and then became Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. He was also a prefect of the Fabbrica of St. Peter’s, a committee responsible for the basilica’s building.</p><p>Francesco interests outside his church career included alchemy and science. Along with his brother Guidobaldo, a mathematician, he helped Galileo get a professorship at the University of Pisa and defended him during the Inquisition. However, Francesco is best known for his patronage of the arts. As Cardinal, he was protector of the Sistine Chapel choir and the Congregazione dei Musici. He succeeded his friend Federico Borromeo as Cardinal Protector of the Accademia di S. Luca in Rome in 1595. Del Monte was also the first major patron of Caravaggio, whose naturalist style he favored. The first two works he acquired by the artist, The Gypsy Fortune-Teller and The Cardsharps, still exist today, as do many others he would acquire throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Francesco was connected with many the other major patrons, including the Medici family, Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani, and Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Although he owned works by fifteenth-century old masters, he was known for his support of contemporary art, a patron of artists such as Simon Vouet, Antiveduto Grammatica, Andrea Sacchi, and Gerrit van Honthorst. Like his contemporary Borromeo, he was also an early patron of Flemish landscape painter Jan Brueghel. He would come to own at least seventeen paintings by Brueghel. The first inventory of his art collection, done a year after his death in 1626, lists a total of 599 paintings, many of them displayed in the Palazzo Madama. The majority of these were portraits, religious themes, and landscapes. One third were works by old masters, including Leonardo, Raphael, and Titian. The rest were all by contemporary artists. This vast and varied collection built over a lifetime- now dispersed in museums and other private collections- ensured Francesco’s position as a major patron and, in fact, his monument boasts that he was an “excellent patron of the good arts”. </p>","Ximena Valdarrago","patron","cardinal/prelate",30,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio27/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio27/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio28","Jan van Kessel (I)","Jan","Van Kessel (I)","1626–1679","<p>Jan van Kessel was born in April 5th, 1626 to Hieronymus van Kessel and Paschasia Brueghel. His father was an accomplished animal painter and a member of the St. Luke’s Guild, which gave his son early exposure to the art world. However, it was through his mother’s family that van Kessel had access to the full range of European artistic methods and training. She belonged to the Brueghel family of artists and was the grand-daughter of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder, and sister of Jan Brueghel the Younger. Van Kessel’s father left Antwerp in 1636 and his nine-year old son remained to be trained by Simon de Vos and his uncle, Jan II Brueghel. In 1644, when he was nineteen, he joined Antwerp’s St. Luke’s Guild himself, registering as a flower painter. In 1655, he married Maria van Apshoven. The couple would go on to have thirteen children and at least two of van Kessel’s sons, Ferdinand and Jan II, would become painters. Van Kessel produced works for the rest of his life, until his death in 1679, at age fifty-three.</p><p>Though van Kessel’s art is not entirely defined by his family, the Brueghel legacy did have a significant impact on him. Trained by his uncle, Jan the Younger, he was exposed to the Brueghel style, which carried much weight in European art markets. Van Kessel used this to his advantage by adopting some family motifs and themes at the beginning of his career. But while his uncle’s works were often direct copies of his famous father and grandfather, Van Kessel moved away from this practice as he grew older, reworking the past and adding new themes to his family’s legacy. The best example of this is his initial choice to specialize in flower and garland painting, a genre closely associated with his grandfather, Jan Brueghel the Elder. These early works allowed him to establish himself as a talented artist in the Brueghel lineage, and also gave him the opportunity to collaborate with major artists in Antwerp, some of whom were friends of his family. But Van Kessel quickly branched out to new subject matters and would go on to explore landscapes, religious themes, and allegorical subjects.</p><p>At the height of his career, van Kessel produced the miniature scale paintings which would become some of his most enduring works. The small pictures were done on copper and featured subject matter such as insects, shells, and animals. Their diminutive scale emphasized van Kessel’s extreme attention to detail, further highlighted by his deft brushwork and composition. He was especially praised for his depictions of insects and his almost scientifically accurate observations of their bodies. Van Kessel’s miniatures were meant to be seen together and his series sometimes numbered as many as forty individual pieces, placed together to form a single thematically cohesive work. One of these series is The Four Parts of the World (Munich, Alte Pinakothek) in which van Kessel depicts the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe, and America. Each part is made up of one large painting, surrounded by smaller images, each representing an aspect of the region. Van Kessel would complete many such allegories during his lifetime. They earned him acclaim in his own right, independent of his family, and firmly established his place in the European art world. Today, about five hundred works can be attributed to him.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago",,"painter",44,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio28/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio28/fullwidth.jpg"

"bio32","David Teniers the Younger","David","Teniers the Younger","1610–1690","<p>A Flemish painter and engraver, David Teniers (the Younger) was born on December 15, 1610 in Antwerp. As the first son of painter David Teniers the Elder and Dymphna Wylde, he was involved with art by the age of sixteen when he began formally studying under his father. Developing specializations in religious themes, rustic and landscape scenes, and interior pieces, by 1633 he had become a master in the Antwerp Guild. Four years later, on July 4, 1637, he married Anna Bruegel, the daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder; through this marriage, he grew close to the Brueghel family and their important connections, like fellow Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens. It was during this time that he engaged in artistic collaborations with his brother in law, Jan Brueghel the Younger; a prominent example of this is the 1642 Armorer’s Shop, in which Teniers painted the overall scene, including the armorer and his shop, and Brueghel painted the details of armor that lay near their creator. Throughout the 1640s and beyond, Teniers’ standing as a successful artist increased greatly: in 1644, he became the dean of the St. Luke Guild in Antwerp and in 1650 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of the Spanish Netherlands named him court painter. In this position, he curated and maintained Wilhelm’s collection, expanding it to contain about 1,300 pieces, featuring works of famous Italian masters such as Raphael and Titian. Teniers also incorporated pieces by famed Northern artists, mixing works by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan van Eyck into the collection. On May 11, 1656, his wife Anna died; within a year Teniers remarried, wedding Isabella de Fren with whom he had four children. He left his position as court painter in 1659.

"bio33","Federico Borromeo","Federico","Borromeo","1564–1631","<p>Federico Borromeo was born in Milan in 1564 to Margherita Trivulzio and Count Giulio Cesare Borromeo. Upon his father’s death in 1572, he was placed under the custody of his older cousin, Carlo Borromeo. Carlo, then the Archbishop of Milan, wanted Federico to have an ecclesiastical career. He enrolled the young Borromeo in the Studio di Bologna and later at the Collegio Borromeo, where Federico was educated as a humanist. During his time in Bologna, he became interested the Jesuit religious order and, although Carlo did not allow him to join, he remained a deeply faithful man throughout his life. After Carlo’s death in 1584, Federico was pressured by their family to follow in his cousin’s footsteps by obtaining a political position within the church. He moved to Rome in 1586, where he would live for the next fifteen years, and was named a Cardinal by Pope Sixtus V in 1587. He remained in this position until Clement VIII appointed him Archbishop of Milan in 1595. In 1601, at thirty- seven years old, Federico moved to Milan permanently. As Archbishop, he was known to be heavily involved within his own diocese, which included overseeing reforms decreed by the Council of Trent. He lived in Milan until his death in 1631.</p><p>Federico’s spirituality developed fully during his time in Rome and remained with him throughout his life. In particular, he subscribed to what is known as “Christian optimism,” the belief that all things created by God, whether animate or inanimate, are essentially good. Borromeo especially believed that God’s physical creations and gifts were all that was necessary to save humanity. Thus the study of physical nature was enough to lead one to a contemplation of the divine and spiritual.</p><p>His interest in finding spirituality in the physical eventually led Borromeo to the art world during his time in Rome. He began as a Cardinal Protector of the Accademia di San Luca in 1593 and continued to support art throughout his life. Borromeo believed visual art could be used as an aid in devotional prayer and also as a stimulant of spirituality. The culmination of this belief was the foundation of the Ambrosiana in Milan in 1607. It was an institution that consisted of a library, art museum, and art academy, and that aimed to bring together Christian scholarship and the visual arts. The academy especially focused on training artists to create works that followed the decrees of the Council of Trent. When it opened the library had around 30,000 printed books and 15,000 manuscripts while the art museum had 172 paintings. The Ambrosiana is still in operation today, and its archive contains many manuscript letters from Brueghel to his patron.</p><p>Jan Brueghel the Elder was one of Borromeo’s favorite contemporary artists. The two men probably met in Rome in 1593 and Borromeo soon began to commission works by the painter, continuing to be a patron for the rest of his life. Borromeo was especially taken with Brueghel’s landscapes and still lifes. He acquired his first work, Landscape with a Hermit Reading and Ruins, in 1596 and his second shortly thereafter in 1597. Borromeo’s fascination with landscapes arose from his Christian optimist beliefs. Nature was a way to become closer to God, because He could be found in all that He had created. Paintings of nature could substitute as an object of spiritual contemplation during the winter or in an urban environment. Brueghel probably traveled to Milan in his patron’s company when Borromeo moved there, although he stayed with him only for a few months. After Brueghel’s return to Antwerp, Borromeo continued to obtain paintings from him. Most famously, it was at Borromeo’s suggestion that Brueghel developed the genre of flower garlands around devotional images of the Virgin Mary, with collaborators Van Balen or Rubens executing the central imagery. Borromeo made it clear that Brueghel’s garland was the greater source of spiritual fulfillment. Borromeo would eventually own twenty-nine works by Brueghel that now hang in the Ambrosiana Museum that he founded.</p><p>At the Ambrosiana art academy, Brueghel's paintings were used as models for students. Borromeo particularly praised the Four Elements series he had commissioned from Brueghel, as well as Brueghel’s other works, because of their attention to minute detail. Because of his dedication as a patron and collector, Borromeo’s Musaeum is a key primary source on Brueghel. He also collected landscapes by Paul Bril and commissioned a single still life from Caravaggio. All of these works supported Borromeo’s belief that the more accurate the representation of God’s creations, the closer one would be to Him. </p>","Ximena Valdarrago","patron","cardinal/prelate",1,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio33/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio33/fullwidth.jpg"

"bio36","Paul Bril","Paul","Bril","1554–1626","<p>Paul Bril was a sixteenth-century Netherlandish artist who is today most famous for his influence on Italian landscape art. Bril was born in 1553, in either Breda or Antwerp. His father was the painter Matthijs Bril and his brothers were Matthijs and Peter Bril. At age fourteen, Bril was apprenticed under Damiaen Ortelmans, with whom he worked mostly as a background painter. In 1574, Bril left Antwerp and traveled throughout the Netherlands and France. He eventually reunited with his artist-brother Matthijs in Rome around 1582. Despite Matthijs’ unexpected death in 1583, Bril made the city his home until his own death about four decades later. It was here that Bril was able to establish what would grow to be a prolific and successful career as a painter. In 1592, he married Ottavia Sbarra and the pair had eight children, three of whom survived into adulthood. Bril accumulated honors, wealthy patrons, and prestigious commissions. As one of the few Netherlandish artists who resided permanently in Rome, he also had a lasting impact on Italian art. He died on October 7, 1626 at 72 and was buried in the Santa Maria dell'Anima alongside his brother.</p><p>Bril developed his style during a crucial time for landscape art. Among critics, the genre was regarded as one of the lower art forms and did not receive much attention or acclaim. In the art market, however, it was increasingly popular. Bril was inspired by the generation of Netherlandish artists that had come before him, including Matthijs Cock, Cornelis Massys, Hieronymus Cock, and especially Pieter Bruegel the Elder. But Bril also developed an elegant individual style that distinguished him from his contemporaries. His works are notable for their thin lines, subtle use of color, and deft handling of light. He was almost exclusively a landscape artist and his some of his favorite themes were rivers, seacoasts, and the forest interiors also favored by Jan Brueghel. Bril’s technique can also be seen as a response to his brother Matthijs’ style.</p><p>Bril was highly acclaimed during his lifetime and was commercially successful. He received a number of high-profile church commissions and was a ranking member in the Academia di S. Luca, the brotherhood of Sta. Maria in Campo Santo, and the Pontifical Academy of Fine Arts and Letters of the Virtuosi al Pantheon. He worked with many of the notable artists of his generation, including Hans Rottenhammer, Adam Elsheimer, and Jan Brueghel the Elder. His relationship with Brueghel was especially significant to the development of his art and it was through their friendship that Bril was exposed firsthand to Pieter Brueghel’s work. Bril was fourteen years older than Brueghel and he introduced the young artist to a number of techniques that would go on to define his style. The pair remained in contact throughout their lives.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago","collaborator","painter",3,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio36/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio36/fullwidth.jpg"

By 1604, Hendrick II was an established painter but not much is known about where he lived and worked until he arrived at London in 1617. There he married Susanna Gaspoel, who would herself become an artist. The couple remained in London until 1637, when they resettled in the Netherlands. The exact date of Steenwyck’s death is not known but it is likely 1649, the date of his last known painting and the year Susanna was listed as a widow in a public document.</p><p>Steenwyck’s early style is similar to that of his father, and he too became known for his architectural interiors. Many of his earlier interiors are based loosely on either Antwerp’s cathedral or its Jesuit church. We do not know the reason for his move to London but art historians have speculated that because his subject matter was so specialized, he continually needed to search for new clients and patrons; thus London’s growing reputation as a center for high art would have appealed to him. Steenwyck had many important British patrons, including the Earl of Arundel, King James, Queen Anne, and Prince Charles, even at a time when aristocratic circles tended to prefer Italian art. In London he worked with Daniel Mytens, Inigo Jones, and Anthony van Dyck; later, he would also work with Theodor van Thulden, Frans Francken II, Cornelis Poelenburgh, and Orazio Gentileschi. He would even work with his own wife Susanna van Steenwyck, nee Gaspoel, and he continued to paint until his death in 1649.</p><p>Like his father, Steenwyck had ties to the Brueghel family of artists. It is likely that in 1609 he asked Jan Brueghel the Elder to add figures to a few of his late father’s paintings. In that year, added figures to an Interior of a Gothic Church by the elder Steenwyck before selling the picture to his own patron, Federico Borromeo. Brueghel and the younger Steenwyck went on to collaborate on many more works, Brueghel adding figures into his colleague’s painted church interiors.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago","collaborator","painter",47,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio38/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio38/fullwidth.jpg"

As a young man in the 1560s, he moved to Flanders in the pursuit of an artistic career. Van Steenwyck intended to settle in Antwerp but as Protestants, he and his family were forced to relocate to Aachen, where he would live until 1576. In 1573, he married Helena Heylwich, who was part of the Valckenborch family of artists. They would go on to have thirteen children. After the Pacification of Ghent, Van Steenwyck returned to Antwerp in 1577 until he was forced to leave again after the city was retaken by the Spanish. To avoid religious persecution, Van Steenwyck and his family moved to Frankfurt, Germany in May of 1586, where they finally settled. Van Steenwyck became a freeman of the city in June 7, 1587. He would work and remain there until his death in 1603 and he is buried in a Lutheran cemetery in Frankfurt.</p><p>During his time in Aachen, Steenwyck studied with painter Hans Vredeman de Vries, learning about perspective and the representation of architecture. When he arrived at Frankfurt, he was able to secure the patronage of Ernst-Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, for whom he painted mainly ceiling pictures. His first foray into exterior architectural scenes was in 1588. Steenwyck had at least one pupil, Pieter Neeffs the Elder. His oldest son, Hendrick van Steenwyck II, would also have a prolific artistic career in the same specialty as his father.</p><p>Van Steenwyck collaborated with many other artists including Hans Vredeman de Vries, Gillis Mostaert, Frans Francken, the Valckenborch family, and Jan Brueghel. It is not certain when Steenwyck and Jan began to collaborate, or if they worked together at all during Steenwyck’s lifetime; but by 1609, Brueghel was painting figures into some of the deceased Van Steenwyck’s pictures, probably at the request of his son, Hendrik II.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago",,,46,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio39/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio39/fullwidth.jpg"

When he was five years old, Stalbemt’s family moved from Antwerp to Middleburg, where his formal training is believed to have taken place. Stalbemt returned to Antwerp in 1609. In 1610, he was admitted to the Guild of St. Luke, which he became dean of in 1617. Stalbemt married Barbara Verdelft on May 5th, 1613.

Van Mander then describes that he worked for a large portion of his life in the studio of painter and art dealer Antonio van Palermo until moving to the workshop of Hendrick van Steenwijck the Elder.

"bio46","Frans Snyders","Frans","Snyders","1579–1657","<p>Frans Snyders was a Flemish painter most noted for his work in still life and animal imagery. Born in 1579 to Jan Snyders, a wine merchant, and his wife Maria, Frans was one of five children to the couple. At age fourteen, his parents apprenticed him to Pieter Brueghel the Younger, with whom he stayed for four years learning the techniques of 16th- and 17th- century Flemish artistry. During this time, Frans became close friends with Jan Brueghel, who ultimately became the young man’s mentor. Aiding him in his search for patronage, Jan Brueghel pushed the burgeoning artist into the practice of painting animals and still-life; as time progressed, this became Snyders’ specialty and trademark. In 1602, at age twenty-three, Synders joined the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp, which at the time was under the joint diaconate of Jan Brueghel and Otto Van Veen. By 1609 he had traveled to Milan under the instruction of Brueghel, visiting Brueghel’s patron Federico Borromeo there. Upon his return to Antwerp, he began his own shop and apprenticeship program (though he only took on three apprentices in his lifetime). From 1610 on, Snyders and his work rose in popularity and value; Brueghel himself noted in a letter that his mentee was encumbered with labor, had carved out a particular fame for himself in the field, and was able to increase prices with the exponential bettering of his work. In 1611, Snyders married Margriet de Vos, and though they had no children, the couple remained together until her death in 1647. In June of 1619, the Brotherhood of the Romanists elected him onto their confraternity, of which there were only twenty-five members. By the ninth year of his membership, Snyders had begun serving as Dean for the group. Snyders’ patrons and buyers were typically persons of wealth, social rank, and political clout. Some included Sir Dudley Carleton, the Duke of Buckingham, the Marquis of Leganés, Archdukes Albert and Isabella, the Estates General of France, and the Municipality of Antwerp itself. Snyders died on August 19th, 1657, aged seventy-eight. He left behind a considerable estate of more than 50,000 guilders, a large collection of art, and general wealth willed to close relatives and to the poor.</p><p>By Saffron Sener</p>","Saffron Sener","collaborator","painter",38,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio46/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio46/fullwidth.jpg"

Also known by the Latin forms of his name, Octavius Vaenius and Otto Venius, he began his artistic career by serving as an apprentice to Isaac Claesz Swanenburgh until 1572. Next, Van Veen transferred to the studio of Dominicus Lampsonius and Jean Ramey, where he remained as an apprentice until 1575, when he embarked on a five-year trip through Italy. His movements are somewhat unclear during this time, but it is known that Van Veen returned to Munich in 1580. By 1585 he was back in Brussels and had been appointed court painter of Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma. This position lasted until his move to Antwerp in 1592, where worked to meet the high demand for altarpieces and other church decorations; it was also during this time that he started his own workshop. One of his most notable students was Peter Paul Rubens, who was an apprentice in Van Veen’s studio from around 1595 to 1598. In 1593, he became a master in the Guild of St. Luke. Soon he began to aid Archduke Ernest of Austria in the acquisition of artwork by distinguished local painters, including pieces by Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. In the late 16th and early 17th century, he collaborated with Jan Bruegel the Elder in works that may include a Battle of the Amazons and Crucified Christ Before Jerusalem. During this period, he was also active in the production of emblem books, works containing allegorical pictures and matching texts, in which his humanist values were illustrated. In addition to this, van Veen created many works for Archdukes Albert and Isabella and served as dean for the Guild of St. Luke in 1602 and for the Romanists in 1606. In 1615, he moved to Brussels where he became a member of the local painter’s guild; on May 6th, 1629, he died at age 73.</p>","Saffron Sener","collaborator","painter",49,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio47/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio47/fullwidth.jpg"

He was exposed to the Flemish art world from an early age by his father, Frans the Elder, and his uncle, Hieronymus Francken. Alongside his older brother, Hieronymus II, he trained under his father in Antwerp and under his uncle in Paris. As a young man in 1605, he became a master at the Guild of St. Luke, and would go on to hold a number of high-ranking positions in the guild, eventually becoming deacon in 1616. By 1607, he had his own workshop; and in November of that year, he married Elisabeth Plaquet. The couple would have nine children and at least two of their sons, Frans III and Hieronymus III, would become painters themselves. Francken enjoyed a critically and commercially successful career and had a significant role in the development of early seventeenth-century Flemish art. He died on May 6, 1642, having cemented his family’s artistic legacy and secured his own.</p><p>Francken was a highly prolific artist and sold originals as well as copies and prints of his works. Though Francken was a technically skilled artist, it was his development of new subject matter that had the most profound effect on Flemish art. While his output included many traditional subjects with historical, allegorical, and religious themes, he is best known for his invention of several new genres. Among these are his famous “monkey kitchen” works, which present traditional genre scenes acted out by monkeys. These usually had some sort of moral message or were read as commentary on human society. Francken was also the inventor of the “art collection” picture or paintings that depicted other works of art. He finished the first of these in 1914. It was this predilection for strange and offbeat subjects that would make Francken such a popular figure in the Flemish art market.</p><p>Francken worked with a number of collaborators, including Tobias Verhaecht, Abraham Govaerts, Hans Jordaens III, Hendrik van Steenwijk I, and his brother, Hieronymus Francken. Among his collaborators was also Jan Brueghel the Elder. Francken had been influenced by Jan’s father, Pieter Bruegel, and he in turn acted as an inspiration for Jan. The younger Brueghel was interested in Francken's unconventional themes and compositions, and often contributed flowers and other background details to Francken’s paintings. It can be assumed through their numerous collaborations that they had a close working relationship. Jan was particularly engaged by Francken’s imaginary art gallery paintings, in which Francken often depicted artworks similar to those Jan was painting, so that Francken’s pictures represent a dialogue of ideas between the two artists.</p>","Ximena Valdarrago",,,21,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio50/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio50/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio51","Peter Paul Rubens","Peter Paul","Rubens","1577–1632","<p>Peter Paul Rubens was born in Siegen, Germany in 1577 to Jan Rubens, a Protestant lawyer and alderman, and Maria Pijpelinckx. In 1568 while serving as her secretary, Jan had an adulterous affair with Anna of Saxony, Princess of Orange. The family was exiled from Antwerp to Westphalia where Peter Paul was born roughly a decade later. At the age of twelve, after the death of his father, Rubens and his family moved the family back to Antwerp, the city that would foster his enormous individual fame and his success as a collaborator of Jan Brueghel.</p><p>Once in Antwerp, Rubens was enrolled in the prestigious Latin school of Rombout Verdonck and by age thirteen became the court page in the household of Countess Marguerite de Lalaing d’Arenburg. Both Classics and court society would become recurring motifs throughout his life; in his adulthood Rubens was fluent in six languages, collected ancient gems and other objects, and had Classical texts read aloud to him as he worked. His early introduction to Classical education and the social nuances of the elite class afforded him flexibility and freedom in his relationships with patrons who entrusted him with artistic and diplomatic commissions alike.</p><p>Young Rubens quickly grew bored with the court routine and began an apprenticeship with the landscape painter Tobias Verhaecht. In 1594, after a further apprenticeship with history painter Adam van Noort, he went to work under Otto van Veen, a distinguished artist and intellectual who directed a large studio in Antwerp. Rubens may have worked with Van Veen until his departure for Italy. All the while, the voracious young Rubens pursued his own artistic self- training; he copied the early prints of German masters, attempting to broaden his visual lexicon. He became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1598 just one year after Jan Brueghel was admitted into the Guild as a “master’s son.” This artists’ society was likely the initial point of contact for Rubens and Brueghel who completed their first collaboration, The Battle of the Amazons, in 1599 (Potsdam). </p><p>Shortly after the completion of this inaugural collaboration, in 1600, Rubens left for Italy. His first stop was Venice, where he studied the works of Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto; then he came to Mantua, his most settled home during his eight year Italian sojourn. In Mantua he worked at both painting and duplicating portraits for Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga. During this time Rubens was given access to the duke’s private collection—an assemblage of fine art from both the Classical and Renaissance periods which he studied assiduously. From Brussels, Archduke Albert, the regent of the Spanish Netherlands, had kept himself aware of Rubens’ progress abroad, and in 1602 he commissioned the artist to paint an altarpiece for Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Albert’s former titular church in Rome. While in Rome Rubens absorbed the lessons of both the High Renaissance (especially Michelangelo) and antiquity, including the Belvedere Torso and the Lacoön among other great works. He became enamored of the sculptural quality of human anatomy, an interest that would later become his speciality in collaborations with Jan Brueghel. </p><p>In 1603 Rubens was sent as an emissary from the Gonzaga court to that of Philip III in Madrid. He remained there for a period of eight months from which time there is only one documented commission: the equestrian portrait of the Duke of Lerma (Madrid, Prado). Six years into his Italian sojourn, Rubens had already accomplished his first diplomatic mission and began to feel stifled by the Gonzaga court. He requested permission to remain in Rome, and with it granted he moved in with his brother on the Via de la Croce. While in Rome he received the commission to paint the altarpiece for the Oratorian Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella which was one of the most prestigious commissions available within the city at that time. The altarpiece came to completion in the same year as his Italian excursion. </p><p>In 1608 Rubens left Italy for Antwerp to see his mother who had grown ill, but did not arrive until a few days after her death. Rubens vacillated; he was unsure whether he should return to the security of his fame in Italy or attempt to make a career for himself in Antwerp. He chose the latter option and within a few short years, his resolution to achieve renown in Antwerp proved successful. By the time Rubens returned to Antwerp, Jan Brueghel had become very well established as an artist and member of the elite community. He had served as both co-dean and dean of the Guild of Saint Luke, served as a painter to the court of Archduke Albert and Archduchess Isabella, and had enjoyed for roughly a decade membership in Confratum Collegij Romanorum apud Antuerpienses, a prestigious group of Antwerp citizens who had spent time in Rome. Through his close friendship with Brueghel, who introduced him to this community of Antwerp Romanists among other prominent social relations,and the swift growth of his own artistic reputation, Rubens quickly achieved eminent status within Antwerp society. Within the first year of his return he was commissioned to paint The Adoration of the Magi (Madrid, Prado) for the Antwerp town hall. In 1609 he was appointed the court painter to Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella and enjoyed privileges similar to if not more extravagant than those allowed to Brueghel. With his standing in Antwerp established, he married. He bought for his new bride, Isabella Brant, and himself a home in the most posh area of Antwerp, while for his pupils and assistants he designed an adjacent studio in the Italian style. </p><p>Though features of his style —his distinct interest in in Classical subject matter, his mastery over the human form, and his preference for working on a large scale-- betray Italian influences, in Antwerp, Rubens modified elements of his artistic process to suit the aesthetic of the North in which he had been trained. One such alteration was his adoption of the collaborative method of production, a custom particularly characteristic of Antwerp’s artistic community in this period, which he had engaged in once before when he painted the Amazons with Jan Brueghel. His next collaboration, made jointly with Frans Snyders, was probably The Recognition of Philopoemen (Madrid, Prado). This was the beginning of another enduring collaborative relationship as he and Snyders would continue to create joint works until Rubens’s death. Apparent in his relationship with Snyders and these early collaborations is Rubens’ understanding of and commitment to creating works in concert. At times when Snyders followed Rubens’s design, their techniques were so similar that it is difficult to differentiate between the work of the two artists; Rubens approached the task of guiding their collaboration minded towards creating a work that represents at once cohesion in thought and the individual excellence of each painter. </p><p>The reciprocity of this sentiment between Rubens and Brueghel, coupled with the intimacy of their relationship, seems to indicate why the two artists were able to maintain such an unparalleled and prolific collaborative career. In addition to the roughly two-dozen unique works they created during their twenty-five year collaboration, Rubens and Brueghel worked together on more personal projects. On the altar above the tomb of Brueghel’s father, painter Pieter Bruegel, Rubens painted The Delivery of the Keys to Saint Peter and he also painted a portrait of Brueghel with his family (London, Courtauld Institute). Letters to friends and patrons, such as those written to Cardinal Borromeo, document their affection: Rubens often served as Brueghel’s secretary and transcribed Brueghel’s words in his own hand, while Brueghel recommended his friend’s work to his patron.</p><p>Though Rubens occupied a more illustrious position within the court, it was usually Brueghel, nine years Rubens’s senior, who acted as the lead for their joint compositions. Only one collaboration, The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man (The Hague, Mauritshuis), bears the signatures of both artists, and a few more are marked with Brueghel’s alone. Clear in each work is that the two artists understood the collaborative process as one which provides the opportunity for study and improvement; at times they borrowed motifs from each other. They used the latest innovations, and likely the two artists usually worked on their collaborations without the assistance of their workshops. Their most well known shared works include The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus, The Garden of Eden with the Fall of Man, The Five Senses Series, and several versions of the same theme of The Madonna and Child with Flower Garland. </p><p>The two artists continued to collaborate until Brueghel’s death in 1625, the first of two deaths in the mid-1620s that would momentarily disrupt Rubens’s artistic career; the following year he lost his wife, Isabella Brant, to the plague. For eighteen months he turned to diplomacy as a distraction from his grief. During this time he was given the responsibility for traveling between England and Spain to negotiate peace for the Spanish Netherlands and was knighted twice, by the kings of each respective country. This diplomatic interlude gave him the opportunity to resume the study of art in a manner similar to that of his early career. While in Madrid he returned to his study of Titian’s works, made copies of his paintings (a revival of the duplication work from his time in the Gonzaga court), and befriended painter Diego Velasquez. Though he traveled to various European countries to make diplomatic negotiations he was able to complete with his workshop many impressive pieces. In the mid-1620s he returned to Antwerp briefly to paint The Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the Cathedral of Antwerp. Later, in 1629, while in London he painted the Allegory of Peace and War (London, National Gallery) which was given to Charles I as a gift.</p><p>As many times before in his life, he grew tired of the diplomatic profession and returned to Antwerp. In 1630 he remarried; he spent much of the ensuing decade with his new bride, the 16-year old Helen Fourment, and his young family. In the early 1630s he conducted two of his final commissions intended for public display: the Saint Ildefonso Altarpiece in memory of Archduke Albert and the triumphal entry into Antwerp for Archduke Ferdinand. After their completions he bought a country home, Chateau de Steen. There he spent his time painting landscapes–subject matter humble in comparison to that of the major public commissions that marked his career–and leading an increasingly private life until his death in May 1640. </p>","Cecily Manson","collaborator","scholar, diplomat, painter",34,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio51/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio51/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio52","Jan Brueghel the Younger","Jan","Brueghel the Younger","1601–1678","<p>Jan Brueghel the Younger was an artist and art dealer, born in Antwerp on September 13th, 1601. He was eldest son of Jan Brueghel the Elder and his first wife Isabella De Jode. From an early age, Brueghel was exposed to the art world. He belonged to the eminent Brueghel family of painters, as the child of Jan I, nephew of Pieter II, and grandchild of Pieter I. His mother’s father was the engraver Gerard De Jode and he was the godchild of Peter Paul Rubens. He followed in his father’s professional footsteps, as was then customary, and began his artistic training in his father’s studio at the age of 10. This was followed by a trip to Italy, then a rite of passage for young artists throughout Europe, where he stayed briefly with his father’s patron, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. He then left for Sicily and was in Palermo by 1623. His father and three brothers died of cholera in 1625, leaving young Jan the new patriarch of the Brueghel family. Shortly after their deaths, he returned to Antwerp and married Anna Maria Janssens, the daughter of painter Abraham Janssens, on July 5th, 1626. The couple would have eleven children, including five sons who would go on to be painters themselves. With the exceptions of a few short journeys, such as one to Paris in 1651, he remained in Antwerp for the rest of his life, managing and continuing the Brueghel legacy. He died on September 1st, 1678.</p><p>In his father’s workshop, Brueghel’s tasks had likely included making copies of his father’s pictures and helping the paid assistants with their work. This training made him familiar with his father’s style and that influence would be evident in his works throughout his life, to the point where art historians frequently have trouble differentiating between a later Jan I and an early Jan II. The few noticeable differences between father and son include different brushwork and more negative space in the paintings of the younger Brueghel. He did establish himself as an independent artist and, in 1625, joined the St. Lucas guild. He would become deacon of the guild between 1630 and 1631. As a painter, his themes—like those of his father--included still-lifes, Christian narratives, mythological scenes, water scenes, rustic scenes, animals, and allegories. He too was a prolific painter of landscapes. Brueghel’s biggest commissions were the 1630 Adam Cycle for the French royal court and a group of works for the Austrian court, completed in 1651.</p><p>As had also been his father’s practice, Brueghel frequently collaborated with other artists. He worked with his father’s collaborator Hendrik van Balen until the latter’s death in 1632. Van Balen was known for his work with figures for which Brueghel provided the landscapes and still life details. Through his father Brueghel also knew Peter Paul Rubens, the foremost painter of the period. He worked sometimes with Rubens but more often with one of the many artists in Rubens’ studio. His contributions then consisted primarily of still-life work. In addition, Brueghel’s journals mention working with Abraham Janssens, Lucas van Uden, David Teniers the Younger, Adriaen van Stalbemt, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Abraham van Diepenbeek, Jan van Kessel, Frans Wouters, and Gonzales Coques. In many cases no instances of such collaboration can be identified today.</p><p>Alongside his painting, Brueghel also maintained a very successful and profitable career as an art dealer. He completed many of his father’s unfinished works after his death and sold these alongside his own works. He also either altered or copied some of his father’s sketches for his own work and sold copies of his father’s paintings, helping to perpetuate the Brueghel legacy. Brueghel’s work can be found in private collections and museums such as the Alte Pinakothek (Munich), the Getty (Los Angeles) and the Metropolitan (New York).</p>","Ximena Valdarrago","collaborator, dealer","painter, art dealer",4,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio52/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio52/fullwidth.jpg"
"bio53","Hans Rottenhammer","Hans","Rottenhammer","1564–1625","<p>Hans Rottenhammer was born in 1564 in Munich, where he was also raised and received his initial artistic training. His father was an attendant at the Munich royal court, and the young Rottenhammer was apprenticed to court painter Hans Donauer in 1582. Rottenhammer studied with Donauer for six years, and during this time he was exposed to the court style popular in northern Europe. After completing his apprenticeship, Rottenhammer traveled to Italy. After a brief detour in Venice, he settled in Rome. Here, he established himself as an independent artist and mingled with other prominent painters and draughtsmen. Among these were a number of fellow northern Europeans, including Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel. He also made frequent trips to Venice before eventually moving back there in 1595. Rottenhammer spent nearly a decade in Venice and his art bears the influence of Venetian masters like Tintoretto and Veronese. Rottenhammer established a studio in the city and accumulated patrons and collectors, as well as students and followers. In the early 1600s, he joined the Venetian artists’ guild. He also married Elisabetta d’Fabris, and the couple had two sons, both artists. In 1606, Rottenhammer relocated to Augsburg, Bavaria, where he spent the rest of his life. Though he was a renowned painter, Rottenhammer spent the latter half of his life fighting off the many debts he had accumulated. He died, acclaimed yet penniless, in 1625.</p><p>Like many northern European artists who spent time abroad, Rottenhammer’s style was a combination of traditional German techniques with Italian influences. In particular, Rottenhammer employed Northern landscape elements and the compositional and figural means of the Italian masters. His most commercially successful works were done during his time in Venice, whereRottenhammer became famous for his cabinet paintings. These were small works done on copper and usually featured religious or mythological themes popular at the time. Rottenhammer shifted his focus after he returned to Augsburg in 1606, where he mostly painted altarpieces and took on large palace commissions.He was also in contact with many prominent patrons, including Cardinal Federico Borromeo, Caspar Kechel, and Emperor Rudolph II of Austria.</p><p>Rottenhammer first encountered Jan Brueghel during his years in Rome. He, Paul Bril, and Brueghel were frequent collaborators. Brueghel introduced Rottenhammer to Cardinal Borromeo, who would go on to become one of Rottenhammer’s most frequent patrons. The two painters worked on Borromeo’s commissions together, with Rottenhammer providing the figures for Brueghel’s landscapes.The artists stayed in contact for many years after both left Rome, and even continued to produce collaborations by sending one another the copper plates on which they had worked.</p>",,"collaborator","painter",33,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio53/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio53/fullwidth.jpg"

"bio8","Charles duc de Croÿ","duc de Croÿ","Charles","1560-1612","<p>Charles III de Croy, Duke of Croy and Aarschot and Prince of Chimay, was born in Beaumont in 1560. His father was Philippe III de Croy, who served as governor of the Citadel of Antwerp in 1577. One of the great old nobles of the Netherlands and a powerful military commander, Charles entered the Revolt of the Netherlands on the Protestant side and then switched to support Spain, handing over several key cities in the process. He continued as a military commander and then a peace negotiator, and became a member of the Council of State in 1600.</p><p>Under Charles, the family’s long-standing tradition of patronage reached its peak. His collection included jewels, medals, coins, furnishings, and manuscripts. In one castle alone, 234 paintings hung at the time of his death, including works by Rogier van der Weyden, Frans Floris, Gossaert and Veronese. It is possible that he was a patron of Jan Brueghel, particularly the Battle of Issus. Because his collections were broken up by his heirs, Charles is most famous today for his Albums, which were watercolor sketches on parchment of every village, river, abbey and chateau in his vast territories. In total, the Albums contain 2,500 sketches. An amateur botanist and scholar, he corresponded with Clusius, Peiresc, and Lipsius.</p>","Rigby Philips",,,19,"biography_item","biographies","/img/derivatives/simple/bio8/thumbnail.jpg","/img/derivatives/simple/bio8/fullwidth.jpg"
