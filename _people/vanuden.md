The son of the town painter, Artus van Uden, Lucas joined Antwerp’s Guild of St. Luke as a “master’s son” in 1626-27. His grandfather was Pieter van Uden, the founder of a well-known tapestry workshop in Antwerp. Lucas was likely trained by his father and was heavily influenced throughout his career by recent developments in Flemish landscape painting. He spent most of his career in Antwerp where he lived with his wife Anna van Woelput, whom he married in 1627. 

Lucas van Uden is best-known for his etchings and watercolors, which demonstrate his great talent for observing nature. His biographer wrote that he often took walks into the countryside early in the morning to make landscape sketches, though this might not be the truth, as most of his paintings follow a specific formula. Van Uden’s careful attention to detail in his smaller paintings and his use of decorative elements in his larger paintings place him in the same tradition as Jan Breughel. He was heavily influenced by Rubens as well, and made copies of many of his works. Lucas used many of Ruben’s favorite figures in his own compositions, like cows at a watering hole or a woman carrying a round jug on her head, and adapted stylistic choices like lighting and color from Rubens as well. Because he borrowed so many motifs from Rubens, many believed for a while that Lucas van Uden had been his assistant. However, this was not the case.
