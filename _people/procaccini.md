<p>Giulio Cesare Procaccini was an Italian artist born in Bologna who worked mostly in Milan. Likely trained under Francesco Brambilla, Procaccini was a skilled sculptor who worked for several years on facades and statues for Milan’s Cathedral, Santa Maria presso San Celso, and the Cremona Cathedral.  </p>
<p>Around 1600, Procaccini shifted his focus from sculpting to painting. He painted frescoes in cathedrals across Milan. </p>
<p>While Procaccini’s late stylistic choices mirror earlier styles of art, his use of drapery and light set his work apart from preceding periods. He was heavily influenced by mannerism-- the chosen style of his father, Ercole Procaccini the Elder--  and Venetian colorism, and his latest works seem to anticipate Baroque style. He collaborated with Jan Brueghel on <em>Garland with the Virgin and Child and two Angels</em> in 1619. </p>
