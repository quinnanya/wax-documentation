comment: "<p>Motifs from this painting and from the version of the same subject in
  Budapest (Ertz 1979 #66) are combined in the following works with the same subject:
  Brussels, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten; private collection in Antwerp;
  picture formerly with Christieâ€™s, London (sold 4.vii.97 #239). The quality of these
  works varies a great deal: the Brussels painting is very good (it is sometimes attributed
  to Jan the Younger) whereas the Antwerp painting seems very weak.</p>"
