comment: '<p>The hat and feathers on the central monkey, a difference from the other
  version, are a slightly later (still 17th century) addition to the work. Our thanks
  to the owner for this information. He further remarks: "Comparing the two paintings,
  there are two things that immediately strike the eye. First of all, the coloring,
  "singerieII" is much less colorful than "singerie I " [the present work], secondly,
  "singerie II " is much less worked out or much less detailed. It is obvious that
  the present work was the first conceived, for it is impossible to imagine that a
  second version would show more recognisable details than a first version. To that
  regard it is important to compare the monkeys sitting on the cupboard. As where
  the middle monkey is merely a suggestion of an animal in the " singerie II ", one
  can clearly see it is a monkey giving an ox to the monkey left of him in the present
  work. The detailing in the clothing of the persons on the two portraits hanging
  high left is also a lot more apparent . The clothing of the woman is very similar
  to the "Parisian style" clothing appearing on the "portrait of Jacqueline van Caestre"
  by Rubens or Van Dijck dating from late 1617 or first halve of 1618.</p>'
