comment: "<p>Dating on this seems rather hypothetical, based on notion that the two
  artists would have been in contact in Brussels at this time, which is not at all
  necessary. Several of the figures are repeated in other works by De Clerck, including
  another painting in the Prado on which he collaborated with Alsloot. There is a
  copy of this picture that was sold by Philips, London, July 4 2000 #147. </p><p>A
  partial copy containing the allegories of air and fire attributed to Jan Brueghel
  the Elder was sold by Sotheby's, New York, Jan 12, 1995, #29.</p>"
