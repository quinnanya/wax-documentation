comment: "<p>Ertz 2008-10, p.548, says that Jan did all of his parts first, on a Peeter
  Stas plate, and then sent it to Rottenhammer to complete. I do not know if he could
  tell this from examining the actual picture or if it is a logical supposition from
  doing long-distance collaboration on an Antwerp-produced plate. The picture was
  also signed and dated by Rottenhammer but not by Brueghel. </p><p>This work was
  displayed in Maastricht at TEFAF in 2007.</p>"
