comment: '<p>The present painting is not one of Jan''s best, although clearly some
  buyer at Sotheby''s liked it! The composition avoids faces, which seems odd to me.
  However, it is certainly immensely superior to the possible studio version which
  Ertz now accepts as autograph, Ertz 2008-10 cat. #224. Weak copy sold Milan (Finarte)
  4.iv.89 #289 as Jan the Younger.  Copy with St. Lucas, Vienna, 1997 (copper, 22
  x 31) seemingly sig. & d. 1608.</p><p><a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2010/old-master-and-british-paintings-evening-sale-l10033#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.L10033.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.L10033.html/13/+r.o=/en/ecat.notes.L10033.html/13/">Sotheby''s</a></p>'
