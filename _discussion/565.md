comment: '<p>In his review of Díaz Padrón''s 1975 collection catalogue, Hans Vlieghe
  said that he did not see Rubens''s hand here and that the now-destroyed version
  once in Berlin was much better (Art Bulletin, December 1979). Others had also formerly
  suggested that Jan had painted the whole thing. More recently it has been consistently
  accepted as a genuine Rubens/Brueghel collaboration.<br />In the 1686 Alcázar inventory
  it is described thus: "...san Huberto de mano de Rubens, el país ciervo y caballos
  de mano de Bruxel."</p>'
