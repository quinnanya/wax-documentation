comment: "<p>copy sold London, Phillips, 27 February 1990, lot 18.</p><p>Based on
  an anonymous kunstkammer painting now in Warsaw in which this picture appears, it
  has been suggested that the original was purchased by Prince (later King) Vladislaus
  Sigismundas Vasa who was travelling in the Low Countries around 1624. This evidence
  is far from secure but the connection is plausible. For documentation of the Prince's
  purchases of paintings from Jan see Szmydki 2000. </p><p>Unusual among Jan's flower
  garlands in that the garland is completely floating in space, not anchored to the
  ground or to any kind of landscape. Could be tied to what appears to be the iconography
  here: the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (on the crescent moon, before the
  sun). But in a private communication, James Clifton says that the iconography here
  is not necessarily that of the Immaculate Conception, which was still under debate
  in the 1620s (supported by the Jesuits and Franciscans, rejected by the Dominicans).
  Apocalyptic Woman imagery was applied to the Immaculate Conception but was used
  in other contexts too. Clifton notes that the Virgin-on-the-Moon imagery was used
  for the so-called Virgin of Antwerp, who stands on a crescent moon. Also anomalous
  is that in this painting, the Christ child is holding Eucharistic symbols.</p>"
