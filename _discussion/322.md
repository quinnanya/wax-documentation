comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue. In Honig database
  as questionable but it is very possibly an autograph work and related to the Italian
  landscape in the Louvre dated 1610. The two are identically sized. Is it possible
  that the date on one has been mistranscribed?</p>"
