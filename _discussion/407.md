comment: <p>Animals here related to other very early paradise landscapes in Doria
  Pamphilj and the Munich collaboration with De Clerck. THe horse in this painting
  is slightly more sophisticated than the ones in those, but the leopard and lion
  seem to be copied quite exactly; could there have been a pattern drawing? Strangely,
  in the background of this picture there is a Flemish "village kermis" taking place,
  with a couple dancing, music-making etc., I suppose to represent the decadence of
  Noah's world. There are also several footless birds of paradise flying in the air.
  </p><p>Sotheby's says this has been in a private collection in Milan, so chances
  are good that it had been made for a patron there and remained there. </p><p>Sold
  January 29, 2015 for $3.9 Million.</p>
