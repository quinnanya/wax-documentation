comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Five versions are known of this composition
  with wild animals, probably all copies after a (now lost) original by Pieter Bruegel.
  The BM sheet and one in the Fondation Custodia, Paris (inv.no.8025) are qualitatively
  the best. The Paris sheet has traditionally been attributed to Jan Brueghel the
  Elder, while the other versions are considered anonymous copies. Three other versions
  are kept in the Art Institute of Chicago (inv.no.22.1932) and the Mus√©e du Louvre,
  Paris (inv.nos.20724 and 20725)."</p>'
