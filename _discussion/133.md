comment: "<p>Bedoni (p.149) notes a copy that was formerly in the Melzi collection
  in Milan, presumably this picture. </p><p>This is an autograph version of the painting
  in the Ambrosiana; Pijl in Ambrosiana 2006 says that the Thyssen copy is inferior.<br
  />The gound layer is applied with fingers (fingerprints visible) to achieve smoother
  surface.</p>"
