comment: '<p>British Museum website: "The signature is probably not by Jan Brueghel
  the Elder (Brueghel usually signs with ''Jean'' or ''Giovanni'' and ''Brueghel''
  with ''h''). It is not clear if this quickly made sketch is a preparatory study
  for a painting or rather a ''ricordo'' of a painting that had left the artist''s
  studio; no painting showing the exact composition is known. Similar flower arrangements
  paintings are now in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena (inv.no.F.1972.13.P, attributed
  to his son Jan Brueghel the Younger) and others recently on the art market (see
  ''Old Master Paintings including the Henle Collection'', Sotheby''s London, 3 and
  4 December 1997, p.81, under no.38; ''Importants Tableaux Anciens'', Sotheby''s
  Monaco, 2 and 3 December 1989, p.42, under no.322, p.41, fig.322 (also at Sotheby''s
  New York 26 Jan. 2006 lot 17), and Sotheby''s New York, 15 January 1993, lot 87."</p>'
