comment: "<p>Although this is now displayed as a pendant to Ertz #557 which shows
  the Archduke and Archduchess outside of Mariemont, the two works actuallly have
  different provenances and were thus not intended as pendants. They seem rather to
  both be part of a group of small-format pictures that Jan painted around this time;
  Munich catalogue reaches same conclusion. Query are these possibly the ones we know
  he did for Brussels (De Maeyer document)?</p>"
