comment: '<p>Pijl has suggested that this was an original Colonna commission and was
  a pendant to the Wide River Landscape with Resting Travellers that was Ertz 1979
  #4. I don''t see why they should be "pendants": like Borromeo, the Colonnas were
  clearly buying up a lot of Brueghels of identical size and support. It is moreover
  not clear that these were original commissions of theirs -- why were certain works
  kept forever and others sold off? There is also a painting by Bril dated 1594 that
  shares a provenance with this and Ertz 4: it is also on copper, 18 x 23.5 (so smaller
  than the Brueghels). It was in the Cologne/Antwerp exhibition of 1992; in the Cologne
  catalogue it was #23.1.</p><p>A loose copy of this painting was in the Gem√§ldegalerie,
  Vienna, #984 (panel, 70.5 x 97 cm). It was shown by F. Bruckman A.G., in Munich.<br
  />The present painting was at the TEFAF in Maastricht, 2007.</p>'
