comment: '<p>British Museum website: "A study for the print by Aegidius Sadeler from
  the series ''Vestigi della Antichita di Roma'' dated 1606 (Hollstein 151-201; wanting
  in BM), for another print study see also SL,5236.50. Made around 1604, they are
  not drawn from life in Italy and must be based on the sketches from his Italian
  travels between 1589 and 1596."</p>'
