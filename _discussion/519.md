comment: "<p>Judging from photograph, painting seems to be in very poor condition,
  which may be why it lacks Brueghel's typical fine detailing. I find attribution
  not entirely secure.</p><p>There is a print of this subject by Aegidius Sadeler
  II after a drawing by Jan which is in a private collection (ill. Ertz 2008-10, p.631).
  \ This painting is after the drawing, not the print, which might argue for its authenticity.
  For the print see Hollstein vols. 21-22, #211.</p>"
