comment: "<p>Based on 1594 print by Jan & Raphael Sadeler after Marten de Vos which
  showed St. Fulgentius. I don't believe that Brueghel intended the reference to be
  to a specific saint; these paintings seem to be generic hermits. Yet the borrowing
  is, formally, very direct, almost an interpretation of De Vos like his slightly
  later paintings would be interpretations of his father's works. Here, in comparison
  to the original print, the saint has been moved farther back into the picture space
  and made smaller, less wild. The cave has shrunk. All the wildlife in the foreground
  is new. The view to the sea at the left is about twice its original proportion and
  Brueghel has especially increased the extent and exoticness of the distant city.</p>"
