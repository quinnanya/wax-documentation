comment: "<p>There is a weak variant in poor condition on panel with dimensions 14
  x 19 cm in Madrid, Prado, inv. #1445.<br />Poor copy listed at RKD as with dealer
  Katz, Dieren.<br />There is also a copy sold at Schonfeld in Berlin in 1914.<br
  />Numerous further copies listed in Ertz 1979, and with poor photos at RKD; none
  seem to be genuine. This was one of those compositions that worked well and was
  easy to reproduce, apparently.</p>"
