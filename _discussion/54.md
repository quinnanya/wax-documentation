comment: "<p>This painting and its pendant are copies of a pair of works, painted
  by a dozen major Antwerp painters coordinated by Jan Brueghel, that were commissioned
  in 1615 and completed in 1618 as a gift for the Archdukes, and were destroyed in
  a fire in 1731. The originals has been at Tervuren (inventories of 1677, 1701, 1708).</p><p>According
  to Díaz Padrón in Brussels 1985, Jan Brueghel's part was limited t the flowers,
  the animals, the pseudo-engravings, the instruments, and the garland painting at
  the lower right. He further suggests that Jan painted the sliver of (a copy of?)
  his father's Preaching of John the Baptist which can also be seen at the right-hand
  side.</p><p>The Paintings by Rubens seen in the back gallery were all done at around
  this time, ie they were new works. There is a Bacchanal with Leopards (now in Montreal)
  that is mentioned in Rubens's famous letter to Dudley Carlton, and a Tiger and Leopard
  Hunt (now in Dresden). According to Díaz Padrón, Francken copied these works here,
  while Jan Brueghel copied them in Madrid's Sense of Sight. They were not part of
  the Archducal collection. In the front room, the Judgement of Paris does not repeat
  any work of that theme by Rubens but is (oddly) related to his Education of Marie
  de Medici.</p>"
