comment: "<p>One of the works set into holy water stoup by Borromeo, who acquired
  the various pieces, four of them by Brueghel, separately between 1606 and 1618.
  The works have only the loosest iconographic connection.<br />On this particular
  one, Jan wrote to Borromeo in 1606 saying that if Borromeo would return it to him,
  he would add a sacred procession to it; so evidently he first sent an empty landscape.
  By August 25 the painting was back in Jan's hands, he had added the procession,
  and was ready to send it back to Borromeo.<br />Composition of this is based on
  Pieter Bruegel the Elder's <em>Bird Catchers</em>.<br />Pijl notes that the technique
  of painting on ivory with smalt was very rare in the 17th century; there are no
  other examples in Brueghel's oeuvre. All of these four tiny works are very well
  preserved, with translucent glazes that give the miniatures a gem-like quality.</p>"
