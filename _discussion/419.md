comment: "<p>A very large work on copper, was surely executed with specific patron
  in mind, probably somebody in Rome. </p><p>Catalogue of Genoa 1996 claims this to
  be signed and dated Brueghel 16...2, which would have to mean 1612. This seems fine
  to me.  Ertz dates this to 1615; I'm thinking that the dated replica might be at
  least a studio work done after this original. It's related certainly to Getty Noah's
  Ark dated 1613.  Since this is now dated 1612, it makes this the first time that
  he uses the animals from Rubens that he'd use a year later in Getty Noah's Ark.
  \ It is also glaringly obvious that the Paris painting (from Borromeo collection)
  has to date before this; Genoa catalogue points out that the two are related, but
  definitely this one is later.</p><p>Good although a bit roughly-painted copy (from
  what I can tell) although not in great condition in private collection, England
  (the Duke of Northumberland) (canvas (?Ertz now says copper), 25 x 37). Signed and
  dated 1613; Ertz 2008-10, cat. #189. Ertz also accepts what looks to me like a less
  good replica formerly in Goudstikker collection, Amsterdam: (panel, 60 x 96).  Contemplate
  fact that if all these are really studio variants, each is done on a different support;
  that's really peculiar.  In the voorordening box at the RKD there really are endless
  variants of this.  Another one now accepted by Ertz (but definitely not genuine)
  is his cat. #190, canvas 28 x 38, with Gal. William Doyle, NY, in 1984.  He notes
  that it is exceptional in being a small work on canvas, which JB did not otherwise
  do. He didn't do that one either!</p>"
