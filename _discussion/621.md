comment: "<p>This is by a considerable amount the strongest of numerous variants of
  this composition: the density of detail is very characteristic of Jan. There are
  however many versions and variants. A fairish one is Ertz 1979 #78; a later questionable
  very very distant variant is Ertz 1979 #136.   Other more distant works:  Vienna,
  K.M.; Hannover, N.L.; Munich, A.P.; Duisburg, private collection; formerly art market,
  London (Sotheby's 22.vi.60); Stockholm, Nationalmuseum.<br />Related drawing from
  about 1595-6 with Tobias and the Angel in Budapest. Another related drawing dated
  1603 is in Vienna, Albertina.<br />Note at RKD, rejected by H. Gerson, possibly
  Jan II</p>"
