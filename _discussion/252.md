comment: "<p>This painting is a part of a group of works by Bruegel and his followers.
  In particular, this group establishes a bridge between Titianâ€™s famous woodcut of
  goats encircling an old tree and the rise of the new genre of forest views in the
  final years of the sixteenth century.</p>"
