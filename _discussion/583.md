comment: '<p>No known copies of this which itself is unusual. Together with Milan
  allegory of Fire, this is Jan''s earliest work on this theme -- but it is (still)
  a history painting, which is characteristic of Jan -- the change, around this period,
  from narrative paintings to allegorical ones. </p><p>According to Werche this is
  an allegory not a narrative, and there is a note at Rubenianum stating that in 1930
  in the depot in Potsdam there was an "Allegory of Earth" which could have been the
  pendant of the present painting. </p><p>Note similarities between setting of this
  work and the Prophecy of Isaiah, Ertz 2008-10 #219.</p>'
