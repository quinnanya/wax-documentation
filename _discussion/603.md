comment: "<p>Previously this drawing was accepted as an original early work by Jan
  Brueghel, but Schapelhouman's 1987 catalogue argued against this. He suggested that
  this was a follower imitating Jan, or else a copy after a lost early drawing. The
  date of ca. 1600 was suggested by Winner, who accepted it as an original.</p>"
