comment: "<p>Brueghel juxtaposed flowers of all seasons to create a mystical picture
  of paradise. Within this specific composition, snowdrops, daffodils, narcissus,
  grape hyacinths, cornflowers, pansies, buttercups, and bluebells from the field
  are integrated with flowers from the cultivated garden. Roses, carnations, tulips,
  orange lilies, and irises from the cultivated garden mingled with the field flowers
  to produce an exotic appeal.</p>"
