comment: <p>For the "preparatory drawing" see Winner 1961, fig. 24. I agree that this
  could have been a design for the general composition, yet the paintings were clearly
  generated from one another or from some more complete drawing, not from this one
  -- they repeat the full staffage very exactly from one to the next. What then was
  the role of a drawing like the Leipzig one?</p>
