comment: "<p>The animals here are clearly takeoffs on the very early Doria Pamphili
  Paradise Landscape. Since that was definitely done in Rome and the present painting
  was definitely done in Antwerp/Brussels, this indicates that Jan had drawings of
  those animals --particularly, for instance, the lion-- that he brought home with
  him from Italy.<br />De Clerck was a court painter in Brussels; this work was presumably
  done in that context.</p>"
