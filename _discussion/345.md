comment: "<p>This is such a literal copy after the print, with such a large-scale
  single figure, that the attribution to Jan does not seem that secure to me in spite
  of the size and support which are his standard from this time. Jan was certainly
  copying other related prints, but the copies are different. I am provisionally accepting
  this: I can't suggest another attribution but it's a problematic work.</p>"
