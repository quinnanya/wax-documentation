comment: '<p>Markings on the back side of the panel: a stamp of "MV" (Michiel Vriendt);
  brands for "A" as well as the city crest of Antwerp (Ertz 2008-10, p. 1028).</p><p>See
  <a href="https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/7323">the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische
  Documentatie (RKD)</a></p><p>Although Ertz dated this work to ca. 1616 and considered
  it the prime version, the Mauritshuis''s own investigation suggests that it is a
  slightly later copy of the Dexia Bank painting and they now suggest a date for this
  work of ca. 1621-22. I cannot see how an exact copy like this would have been made
  years after the original. The two must have been at least initiated at the same
  time, even if this version was not brought to completion until later when a buyer
  for it was found. </p><p>There is a further copy of this composition in the Prado
  which has been attributed to Jan the Younger but is probably a high-level studio
  work: Prado, #1414, Ertz as Jam the Younger #305, panel, 106 x 73. It would be worthwhile
  trying to untangle the relations between all three of these works.</p>'
