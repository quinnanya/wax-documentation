comment: "<p>Reproduction is not good enough to really judge this one but the street
  feels somehow randomly cluttered and the artist is careful not to show the figures'
  faces, leading me to conclude that it is certainly not by Jan the Elder. Certainly
  relates to works produced in his studio, with many familiar figures from other works.</p>"
