comment: "<p>This painting is nearly identical to the Adoration in the Mayer-van den
  Bergh, inv. #497 (Ertz 231/Honig 00019). If the dating of this piece is correct
  and it was completed in 1594 in Rome, it is therefore likely that he painted both
  at the same time and took the Mayer-van den Bergh version back to Antwerp to form
  the basis for the multiple other variants of the Adoration. Ertz implies that there
  is a date on the Colonna painting but I have examined it and see none.</p>"
