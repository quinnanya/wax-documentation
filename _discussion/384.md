comment: "<p>Two preparatory drawings  in Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen,
  Inv. #4 & #2.  Hermit is based on an engraving by Jan and Raphael Sadelar after
  a design by M. de Vos, the second plate in their series Solitudo sive Vitae Patrum
  Eremicolarium (c.1588); the scene shows The Temptation of St. Anthony Jan leaves
  out the tempting demons here. That subject seems not really to have interested Borromeo,
  who evidently once owned a Brueghel Temptation of St. Anthony and then deacquisitioned
  it. In the engraving the saint occupies a much larger proportion of the picture's
  surface; in the painting, the setting matters more. </p><p>Many different animals
  are figured here, including a footless bird of paradise.<br />Ruin in the background
  is taken from Jan's drawing of Baths of Caracalla; drawing of them dated 1595 is
  also in Rotterdam (Luijten cat. #49).</p><p>Jan's reliance on engravings is not
  that consistent and is actually incredibly normal for painters of his generation,
  in these little cabinet painters.  The works in The Prado NOT by JB but from his
  circle are often based on engravings:  Jan the Younger Abundance (Prado 1402) is
  based on Ph. Galle, Prosopographia, 1574 #3; De Clerck/Alsloot Paradise with Elements
  is based on engravings by Matham after Goltzius and De Bruyn after Marten de Vos
  (in Diaz Padron).</p>"
