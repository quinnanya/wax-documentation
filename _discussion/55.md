comment: '<p>Who exactly executed these copies has been disputed. The 1636 inventory
  called them works by Rubens and Brueghel. In his 1975 catalogue of the Prado collection,
  Díaz Padrón listed them as Brueghel and Van Balen. In the 1995 catalogue he suggested
  Gerard Seghers for the painter of the allegorical figures. He also hypothesized
  that in the original works, the paintings at the right had been "originals" by specific
  artists while those in the gallery to the rear, which replicate known works, were
  filled in by Frans Francken. In the Brussels 1985 catalogue he wavered between attributing
  the figures to Van Balen or to Rubens toning down his style to harmonize with a
  collaborator. Ertz''s attribution of the works to Jan the Younger is impossible:
  he was in Italy in the years before they were sent to Spain and would surely not
  have been entrusted with a major royal commission in his teens. Of course it is
  possible that there was studio work involved in these very large copies.  In 1636
  inventory they were attributed to Rubens and Brueghel.</p>'
