comment: '<p>One of the basic "type"landscapes of which many many copies and variants
  exist.  This original has some damage, but it also has some claim to being the prime
  (or the earliest) of the group.</p><p>The two paintings that Ertz calls possibly
  autograph variants, 1979 #s 161 and 162, are really extremely different.<br />Further
  copies</p><ul><li>One in Prado which Ertz originally suggested was Jan the Younger
  but seems not to have included in monograph on that painter.  </li><li>One which
  may be pretty good was sold Sotheby''s (London) 11.iv.90 #17.  </li><li>OK variant
  sold New York (Sotheby''s 17.i.92 #32), panel, 36.2 x 48.9.  Ertz not only accepted
  this but suggested that the figures were by the young Rubens.  I would not accept
  as Jan, midground shows clear boredom, it could  be a studio work.</li><li>Lousy
  copy formerly art market, London (sold Phillips 10.xii.91 #124), copper, 31 x 39.3</li><li>Feeble
  copy attributed to Jan the Younger (Ertz JBII #28) in Warsaw, Muzeum Narodowe, inv.
  #129170 (panel, 32 x 45.5).  This does not look good enough to be a Jan the Younger,
  figures are awful. </li><li>terrible copy with Brod, London, 1970, panel,  4 3/4
  x 7 1/8 in</li><li>Hysterically funny bad copy from maybe 18th century or even later
  sold Paris, Galliera, 7.xii.76 #31, panel, 36.5 x 47.5.  This injects a bunch of
  motifs from Rubens and maybe Pieter Bruegel, it''s really jolly.</li><li>Almost
  as bad variant with Boskovitch 1972, copper, 36 x 46.</li><li>Also here (Ertz JBII
  #29) a very very distant variant, tiny copper oval, in Enschede, Rijksmuseum Twenthe,
  inv. #51.  For another related work & copies see my q00028.</li></ul><p>More variants
  noted by Ertz:</p><ul><li>Paris, Louvre</li><li>Manchester, City Art Gallery inv.
  #11908/34 (on copper, really awful)</li></ul>'
