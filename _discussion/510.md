comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Although unsigned and not directly related to
  any of Jan Brueghel''s paintings, this study sheet can still be attributed to Brueghel.
  It is, however, less spontaneous than another study sheet showing birds, now in
  Herzog Anton-Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig, inv.no.Z521. It is probably a study sheet
  for a painting showing the Garden of Eden. For a discussion of related paintings
  showing Paradise, see K. Ertz, "Jan Brueghel der Ältere: Die Gemälde", Cologne,
  1979, pp.236-249."</p>'
