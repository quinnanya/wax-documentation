comment: "<p>The faces of the figures are entirely different then those in his later
  works. Jan's always tend to have a drawn, caricatural look whereas these faces are
  modeled. The background is also painted sloppily and the buildings have little detail.
  Ertz also agrees that if this were by Jan at all that the figures would have to
  have been by a collaborator, but none can be distinguished.  However, even the back
  group has elements not typical of Jan such as including multiple moments of a story
  in the same painting and leaving building without detail. Honig hypothesizes instead
  that this was painted by someone familiar with both the work of Bosch and Jan Brueghel.</p>"
