comment: "<p>The panel was possibly cropped on the left and therefore could originally
  have been a horizontal piece instead of a (rare for Jan) vertical one. If this is
  true, it would have been a very large painting. </p><p>Early drawing with this theme
  by Jan in Paris, Fondation Custodia: Swamp Landscape with Temptation of Christ,
  1595.</p>"
