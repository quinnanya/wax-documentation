comment: <p>Based on an extremely poor reproduction from a 1963 catalogue, Ertz not
  only attributes this to Jan, but claims that it is the original version of the famous
  "Bird Trap" in Brussels which he therefore deattributes from Pieter Bruegel the
  Elder. There is a drawing of the lower portion of the composition with Guttmann
  Galleries, New York, on which he supports this argument. The Brussels picture would
  then be a product of Pieter the Younger's workshop based on Jan's design. This is
  a radical and somewhat far-fetched argument, but the attribution of the drawing
  and its relation to the Brussels painting and other versions should be further investigated.</p>
