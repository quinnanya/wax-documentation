comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue nor the Honig Database.
  Studio or later work? The insistence on showing figures from the back and the lack
  of any interest in the faces of interacting humans is totally uncharacteristic of
  Brueghel. This opinion only on the basis of a poor photograph, though.</p>"
