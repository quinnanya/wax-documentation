comment: <p>Two copies are illustrated by Ertz 2008-10, p. 1647. One truly terrible
  one is in Koblenz as attributed to Christoffel van den Berghe (copper, 17.5 x 26.7);
  the other is in Orleans, Musee d'Orleans, and Ertz calls it Jan the Younger (copper,
  27.4 x 34.9). The museum at Orleans calls it "studio of Jan the Elder."</p><p>Image
  on Lempertz website is very poor but way that figures are carefully arranged so
  that artist did not have to paint faces makes me sure this is not an autograph work.
  It's barely even from his studio. Colors are muddy, figures lumpen.</p>
