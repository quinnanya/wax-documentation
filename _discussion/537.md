comment: <p>According to Louisa Wood Ruby, this is the first dated Roman drawing by
  Jan not dependent on earlier models. Like the <a href="/janbrueghel/view-of-the-castel-dellovo">View
  of the Castel dell'Ovo</a>, the motif of the Sybil Temple appears in numerous paintings
  by Brueghel.  However, as Ruby notes, Jan did not use his own drawing as a model.
  Instead he was using a study by Paul Bril (Louvre). Bril's drawing includes the
  arched structure that supports the temple and the small waterfall, while the present
  drawing by Jan is a close-up of the temple with none of the substructure. In Jan's
  paintings with the Temple is it NOT shown close-up, but from a distance and with
  the larger surroundings. Ruby also notes that in the 1595 <a href="/janbrueghel/rest-on-the-flight-into-egypt-with-tivoli-temple-germany">Rest
  on the Flight into Egypt with Tivoli Temple (Germany)</a> Jan reproduced Brilâ€™s
  full Louvre drawing very exactly.</p>
