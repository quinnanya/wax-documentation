comment: "<p>3 copies/variants:  one Koetser 1966 (panel 14 x 19.3, ill. Essen 1997
  p.131 fig.2); second Indianapolis, Museum of Art (copper 10.2 x 11.4)--exhibited
  Essen 1997.  Third variant sold London (Christie's 13.xii.91 # 177 as circle of
  JBI), copper, 14.6 x 17.8.   There are photos of these in RKD voorordening, and
  all 4 are exhibited in Russell article.   A more distant version (?) is illustrated
  Essen 1997, p.131, fig.3. Curious that even Jan's very earliest painting seems to
  exist in such a lot of copies and variants.<br />Another distant but very curious
  variant sold Sotheby's London 3 December 2008, #8 (panel, 15.5 x 18). To harbor
  have been added all these figures from just slightly later JB works, like Ertz 13
  from 1595--a figure group is directly reproduced from there.  Since Ertz 13 was
  in the Barberini Collection and hence didn't leave Italy before 20th century, that
  would mean that either the painter of the Sotheby's picture worked from a drawing
  by JB, or knew the painting in Rome.  But other figures here, especially woman seated
  on basket at far left and figures in midground with cart, are I am sure taken from
  works from school of Beuckelaer, works like Getty picture in fact.  So this is a
  very peculiar pastiche.  Also a tiny painting, same size as Ertz 1, but on panel.</p>"
