comment: "<p>Although Ertz lists this painting as having a copper support, the Christie's
  sale notes emphasize that it is on panel like related roundels by Jan, eg., the
  Munich <em>Flight into Egypt.</em> </p><p>The landscape here is related to a drawing
  of 1593 now in Rotterdam; it is illustrated in Ertz 2008-10, p. 607, with the wrong
  caption.</p>"
