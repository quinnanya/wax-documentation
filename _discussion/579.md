comment: '<p>Another of the standard "pattern pieces" that was clearly replicated
  often or served as the basis for making variants. Many, many copies and variants
  in photographs at RKD.  Ertz lists autograph variants dating to as late as 1619
  (Munich ptg, his 1979 #347).  He also lists a copy by Jan the Younger (or a variant)
  in the Hermitage, and copies by "unknown followers" (probably the studio) in Helsinki,
  Enschede, Koblenz, Berlin, and London art market. These need to be sorted out.</p>'
