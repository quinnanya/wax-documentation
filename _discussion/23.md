comment: "<p>Subject is from the Aeneid, vi.269-282 </p><p>There are versions of this
  composition attributed to Jan the Younger in Brussels MBA (Ertz, Jan Brueghel the
  Younger, #130; Brussels inv. #6249); Ertz JBII #131 in Hardy Collection, Bendorf;
  and Ertz #132 in Antwerp, Kronacker collection.  Ertz says that these were all produced
  by Jan Brueghel the Younger in the 1630s, but how would such replication 30+ years
  later be possible?  How do we know they are that late? There is another copy in
  the Metropolitan Museum of Art which they too date to 1630-40 and attribute to Jan
  the Younger. It seems likely to me that these versions were produced at the same
  time as the original in Janâ€™s workshop. All are of the same size and on copper supports.
  Relatedly, the figure groupings in this work are taken from groupings that Rottenhammer
  had provided for Brueghel's Dresden Juno in the Underworld. However, the groups
  are placed now on opposite sides of the plate than they were in the Juno. Three
  of the men are in the lower right corner but the fourth man, who had not been tangled
  with the others, has been moved over to the left and lies next to the group of women.
  This is interesting in terms of how Jan used drawings in his studio practice. Comparing
  Brussels version to the present work, there are actually tons of little differences
  in the details. The basic larger figure groupings and the general disposition of
  the landscape are identical but many, many smaller figures, animals, demons, hellish
  machines etc. are different. It could easily be copied from a group of study drawings,
  for instance.  In size, the Brussels painting (also on copper) is almost identical
  to this one; the other two versions are very close as well.I also note that the
  supposed Jan the Younger painting sold by Robert Fink in 1962 is a terrible picture
  but is actually closer in some details to the original, has things from this work
  that the (better) Brussels painting does not have. Yet there are also elements in
  the Fink painting that seem to be from the Brussels painting (or one like it) and
  not from the original. How is this possible? Possibly the Brussels painting is the
  key secondary version from which a work like the Fink painting derives.One of these
  copies was sold Christies, London, July 4 1997 #239; the plate it was on had a P.
  Staes stamp on the back, if that helps with dating. There is also a variant in Munich
  (copper, 27 x 41) that Harting attributed to Frans II Francken. Clearly indeed by
  another hand than the rest, very odd. Harting cat. #275A, illustrated on p.51.</p>"
