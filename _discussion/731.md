comment: '<p>According to the Metropolitan Museum''s website, the signature is on
  the verso of the drawing, at the lower left, inscribed "P.Brugel" in graphite by
  a later hand.<br />Jan did another drawing of the castle while he was in Heidelberg,
  now known only through a copy in Stuttgart: see Essen/Vienna, p. 426, n. 8. The
  castle appears from in the background of several versions of Jan''s <em>Allegory
  of Earth</em> from around 1611: Ertz 491-4.</p>'
