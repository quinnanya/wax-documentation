comment: '<p>Influence of Cornelis van Dalem on Jan Brueghel</p><p>Jan Brueghel were
  living from 1578 in Antwerp, the city in which Cornelis van Dalem was active just
  few years ago. He could very probably seen the drawing with St. Antonius, living
  in a cave (<a href="https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/61670" target="_blank">Frankfurt,
  Städel Museum</a>) in a collection in Antwerp. The impact of Cornelis van Dalems
  invention was quite considerable, also on other artists. </p><p>Jan Brueghel could
  also have seen the two pictures, pendants, painted by Bartholomeus Spranger 1569
  in Rome, when he was in service of Cardinal Farnese (both now in Karlsruhe, Kusthalle;
  Oberhuber, Konrad, Die Landschaft im Frühwerk Bartholomäus Sprangers, in: Jahrbuch
  der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen in Baden-Württemberg I, 1964, pp. 173-176, fig.
  142, 143). In the same year he painted also the landscape frescoes in the Palazzo
  Farnese at Caprarola (Bert W. Meijer, Bartholomeus Spranger and Michiel de Joncqoquoy
  in Sant’Oreste, in: Oud Holland, 124/2011, p. 46, note 12). Bartholomeus Spranger
  studied with Cornelis van Dalem in 1560-1564 (Van Mander, 1604, Levens Ned., fol.
  268v-269r). In one of the mentioned paintings from 1569, he copied the cave with
  the wooden construction of Cornelis van Dalem (Karlsruhe, Kunsthalle, inv. no. 2449).
  Obviously he made in Antwerp a copy of the original drawing, which was part of his
  stock, when leaving for Italy.<br />It seems more plausible, that Jan Brueghel saw
  the Spranger picture and perhaps the copy after the drawing of Cornelis van Dalem
  in Rome, given the fact, that Jan Brueghel created the Landscape with Cistern in
  1595 for the Cardinal Federico Borromeo.<br />The hermit on the Landscape with Cistern
  (Milan) Jan Brueghel took over from a print by Albrecht Dürer, St. Anthony in front
  of a City, from 1519 (Meder 51, Panofsky 165).</p>'
