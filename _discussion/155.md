comment: '<p>This seems to be the better of the two related images; the landscape
  and cityscapes are much more detail-filled and characteristic of Jan. I seems possible
  that the figure was actually painted by Jan himself in this case. This could be
  the version that was owned by his son Ambrosius and mentioned in his will of 1639:
  he leaves to David Teniers "een zijn stucxken schilderij van onsen Salichmaecker
  aent cruys, gemaect door den voors. Jan Breughel."</p>'
