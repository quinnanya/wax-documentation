comment: "<p>From CBaisier, Director of the Museum Mayer van den Berghe:<br />Manfred
  Sellink and Till Holger-Borgert saw the grisaille at TEFAF and in our museum, and
  confirm that it is work by Jan I Brueghel. The painting is a copy from the original
  work by Pieter I Bruegel dated 1565 in The Courtauld Gallery London. This painting
  was the only one that never left the family Bruegel, and was inherited by Jan I
  Brueghel.</p><p>Both sons made a lot of copies of the grisaille. All the 15 known
  paintings by Pieter II Brueghel are in colour [see Ertz 1998, pp. 380-386]. Specialists
  suppose he copied engravings. All the paintings by Jan I Brueghel seem to be in
  grisaille, and based on the original work of his father he had in his own collection
