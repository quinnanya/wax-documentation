comment: "<p>This work is kind of a pastiche.  The figure group  is definitely put
  together from other works, including i think the View of Schelle, and the pigs rooting
  around beside the road don't make any sense.  The whole scene doesn't make a lot
  of sense.  There was a drawing for the staffage figures on art market Vienna (Dorotheum)
  1995.  Red chalk, 17.2 x 26.3.  The figures  here aren't his best work.  Wonder
  if there could be studio hands involved here?  Poss is there some sort of village
  with fair in backgound (which would help make sense of all this).</p><p>Two copies
  were on the art market in 1970, one with Gal. Flinck in Brussels and another with
  Christie's, London.</p>"
