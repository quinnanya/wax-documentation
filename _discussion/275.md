comment: "<p>There is something very odd about all these interconnected early hunting
  scenes, which are currently thought to be Jan's earliest works and would predate
  even Coninxloo's work in the forest landscape genre. None are signed or dated, I
  believe; all are interconnected; none really relate to the signed and dated works
  Jan starts doing in Rome, nor the rocky coastal landscapes which were previously
  thought to be his earliest works. Presumably they would be images done for the market,
  since no such works are recorded as by Jan in any of his Roman or Milanese patrons'
  collections.<br />Although I had doubted this group of works, Ertz and Pijl and
  Ruby have made strong arguments in their favor. Ruby argues that another one of
  these Brueghel forest scenes, Landscape with hunters (private collection, Philadelphia)
  may date from as early as 1588, before Jan had even left for Italy.</p>"
