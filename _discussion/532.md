comment: "<p>Schapelhouman suggests that many such study sheets existed in Jan's studio,
  functioning in a way not unlike medieval model books. The draughtsman here has retraced
  the lines of the figures on the verso of the sheet, so that they could more easily
  be used in reverse.<br />The watercolor on the sheet's recto was probably added
  at a later date to make the drawing more collectable.</p>"
