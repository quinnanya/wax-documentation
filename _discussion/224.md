comment: <p>This painting is mentioned several times in Brueghel's letters.  He sent
  it along with Allegory of Fire and a <em>St. Anthony</em> that's now lost to Borromeo
  in Dec. 1608.  </p><p>This is a rarity among Jan's paintings for Borromeo in that
  it was replicated many times; usually the works he sent to Milan remained unique.
  </p><p>A variation of this painting can be seen <a href="http://www.grandimostrecomo.it/assets/templates/gmc/photos/opere/Brueghel_15.jpg">here</a></p>
