comment: '<p>The Rome "Allegory of Water" is part of a series of the elements which
  Jan Brueghel painted between 1606-1611. The series currently resides in the Galleria
  Doria Pamphilj. See also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-earth-rome">Allegory
  of Earth (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-air-rome">Allegory
  of Air (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-fire-venus-in-the-forge-of-vulcan-rome">Allegory
  of Fire: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan (Rome)</a></li></ul><p>Many copies all over
  the place, again; Ertz lists only "better" ones but there are also ones in Burghley
  House, Slot Neues Palais in Potsdam, one recently art market in Paris, Saltram House...   These
  include a number of pretty distant variants.<br />Autograph variant sold Sotheby''s
  London 8.vii.99 #53 with pendant Air; this is now Ertz #498.<br />Apparently independent
  copies (not in series) are about evenly balanced between Doria Pamphilj and Lyons
  versions, at least, there are a lot of each.  What there are not are independent
  copies of the Ambrosiana version.<br />NB that doing elements as pendants rather
  than series--"Earth and Water" as one and then "Fire and Air" as another--seems
  to have been Jan the Younger''s idea.   there are lots of these, again in lots of
  versions--but not by Jan the Elder.   There is however one version that is so much
  better than all the others that it seems to represent a genuine link to Jan the
  Elder''s ideas.  It isn''t anywhere in Ertz.  It''s in the Uffizi, Photo RKD.<br
  />Ertz now accepts 2 "double element" paintings in Potsdam as Jan the Elder; I would
  not agree with this.<br />Many copies and variants in the RKD and Witt Library that
  are listed under the other Allegory of Water paintings.</p>'
