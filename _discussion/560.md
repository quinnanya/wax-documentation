comment: '<p>Prophecy of Isaiah (2:4). Inscription reads as follows: IUDICABIT GENTES,
  ET ARGUET POPULOS MULTOS, ET CONFLABUNT GLADIOS SUOS IN UOMERES, ET LANCEAS SUAS
  IN FALCES.  ISAIAE II  (And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
  people:  and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
  pruninghooks."  Also inscribed between the legs of the putto: PAX. On ground near
  flower basket at right: FOELICITAS. On the cross, PIETAS. On the cornucopia, ABUNDANTIA.<br
  />The figure of Isaiah is in center; Peace is burning a helmet over a fire and holding
  an olive branch.  At forge figures are plunging swords into plowshares.  The Female
  figures at right are fruits of peace:  Felicity, Piety and Abundance. </p><p>Painting
  was probably either commissioned by or given to Maximilian I of Bavaria, leader
  of Catholic League, as reference to conclusion of twelve-years truce in 1609. He
  also owned Jan''s <em>Jonah and the Whale</em> now in Munich.<br />Neumeister in
  Munich 2013 (p.273, note 10) believes that the figures around the smithy are also
  by Van Balen, which seems odd given that this was a subject that Jan had already
  painted on his own before this (a smithy, not Isaiah); she says that one can tell
  this from the manner of painting the flesh but I cannot see this at all.<br />The
  infrared published there shows that the figures were originally conceived as being
  quite a lot larger. Probably the theme of the picture was originally a "Venus at
  the Forge of Vulcan" and it was changed around to accommodate the Isaiah theme for
  this 1609 commission;  hence the work could have been begun slightly earlier.</p>'
