comment: "<p>Ertz 1979 #118 is loosely inspired by this composition.  A variant of
  this was sold Sotheby's London  July 12 2001 #26 (panel, 26.5 x 36) as attributed
  to Brueghel, but without an Ertz certificate.  This is also related to Ertz 1979
  #2a, in Vienna.  These compositions are closely intertwined with works by Coninxloo,
  including one in Vaduz  dated 1598. </p><p>On forest landscapes by Coninxloo, Brueghel
  and Bril inspired by drawings of Pieter Bruegel see Pijl 2000.</p>"
