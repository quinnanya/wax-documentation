comment: '<p>First mentioned in letter to Borromeo of April 14, 1606: after finishing
  the flowers he will start a painting of animals of the "ordinary size." On August
  25 1606 he says it will be the same size as the flower painting (which it was, considerably
  larger than "the ordinary size" of c. 25 x 35 cm). By Feb. 1 1608 Borromeo has received
  the animal painting and Brueghel is glad he is satisfied with it.</p>'
