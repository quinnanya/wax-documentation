comment: "<p>The present work seems to be the best of the surviving variants; others
  probably have more studio work or are entirely by Jan's studio. Good free variant
  in Florence, Uffizi, inv. #1890:  Ertz says maybe Jan the Younger but it's not in
  that catalogue.<br />There is a drawing for the landscape composition in Berlin,
  Kupferstichkabinett. That drawing sketches out the general sense of recession. There
  is also a vaguely related drawing in Stockholm that contains some of the elements
  here (cows, carriage) but not in the same relationship or even position. Another
  related drawing in the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge,is rejected by Ertz.</p>"
