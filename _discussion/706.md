comment: '<p>This is by far the better painting at this museum. It is less densely
  painted and a great deal of the ground layer is visible:  you can see a lot of process
  really clearly.  Rubens must have done his part first but also he did parts of ground,
  including trees, because the figures are completely integrated in terms of poses,
  shadowing and so forth.  The putto/dogs interaction is also nice and unusual and
  argues for a good "understanding" between the two players.  In some of the dogs
  you can clearly see the way Jan first drew a sketch form--some are not even really
  filled in.</p><p>Interesting comparison on how Rubens integrates a figure group
  (the sleeping nymphs) vs. how Brueghel does it with the dogs.  Dogs are much more
  indivuated, linear, cut-outs juxtaposed against one another, at best puzzle pieces.  Rubens''s
  figures are a mass in which individuals emerge and then remerge.  Note how women
  are particularly treated like this.</p><p>In great condition.</p><p>Freedberg, in
  his review of Ertz, doubted that Rubens did the figures here.</p>'
