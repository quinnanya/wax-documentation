comment: '<p>Version of this landscape with completely different figures in Hermitage
  (Ertz as Jan II, #23; panel, 48 x 67). RKD has it as Jan the Elder.<br />Subject
  of this picture is actually the "return from the Kermis" as painted in previous
  generation by Aertsen. Little peasant child at left has a pennant in her hand, and
  in midground two peasant people are helping along a third who is clearly drunk.  The
  rich people have been there too because somebody has stuck a pennant into the lead
  horse''s bridle!  There is a charming little Pieter I moment at far right midground
  where a cowherd is blowing his horn and herding some cattle over the crest of a
  hillock. Really nice, interesting work.</p>'
