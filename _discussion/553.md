comment: '<p>On the 1595 entry in Archduke Ernst''s inventory see Lhotsky 1941-45,
  II/1, p.217: "Kreuzigung" by Brueghel and "Der Gekreuzigte" as "Art [manner] des
  Bruegel." The first of these must actually refer to the piture by Pieter the Elder
  in the Vienna collection. Since the present work definitely is in Vienna by 1619
  the second of these items could plausibly be a reference to it, yet it would be
  remarkable if a work that Brueghel painted in Italy (it would have to be a 1595
  work) reached the Archduke so fast. My inclination is to date this work closer to
  1597 and to think it was acquired for Vienna because of its intriguing similarity
  to works by Pieter Bruegel in that collection. If this painting was done in Italy,
  Jan must have had more drawings by his father with him there than we think. The
  soldiers fighting for the cloak are evidently based on a lost PBI painting that
  PBII eventually produced versions of (one is in the Church of St. Severin in Paris).
  Jan would repeat these figures some years later in his Munich Crucifixion, Ertz
  1979 #54. It is more likely that all of this occurred in Antwerp.</p><p>Another
  version of this subject was owned by Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte; inventory
  of 1627. It is one of the few works from the collections of Jan''s Italian patrons
  that cannot be identified today.</p>'
