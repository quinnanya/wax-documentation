comment: '<p>An unusually frequently-copied large flower painting. Fred Meijer (RKD)
  counts 13 such copies and suggests that many were produced by Jan the Younger and
  his studio. Here are the ones I know of:</p><ul><li>A variant by Jan Brueghel the
  Elder or Jan Brueghel the Younger, (panel, 125 x 95.5 cm) exhibited in Laren, Singer
  Museum, 1963, cat. # 42, fig. 16.</li><li>A copy by Jan Brueghel the Younger (panel,
  125.5 x 96 cm), Munich, Alte Pinakothek, cat. 1957, #824, cat. 1961, #824; this
  copy is attributed by Neumeister in Munich 2013 to the studio of Jan the Elder,
  and dated to around the same time as the Vienna original was produced. In his book
  on Jan the Younger, Ertz argues that this is the "original" copy by Jan the Younger,
  done in his father''s studio before he left for Italy; the other "good" copies are
  then after this copy.</li><li>A copy by Jan Brueghel the Younger (64.5 x 49.8 cm),
  shown at TEFAF 1993 by Scheidwimmer, Munich, 1993.</li><li>A copy by Jan Brueghel
  the Younger (84.7 x 70.3 cm), sold Sotheby''s, London, Dec. 11, 2003, # 56</li><li>A
  copy by Jan Brueghel the Younger (panel, 112 x 84 cm), shown in Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum,
  cat. 1976, #A 3290, as atelier of Jan Brueghel the Elder.</li><li>A poor copy with
  a snail and tulip on the table (108 x 80 cm), Shown at the Straatsburg. Museum,
  1954, cat. on still-lifes, #3</li><li>A copy by Jan Brueghel the Younger (104.5
  x 76 cm), in Bucharest, Muzeul National de Arta al Romaniei, cat. 1981/82, #9.</li><li>A
  poor copy with squirrel by circle of Jan Brueghel the Younger (64.5 x 49.5 cm),
  sold Paris, Douot Montaigne, June 10, 1997, #12.</li><li>A poor copy attributed
  to circle of Jan Brueghel the Younger (115 x 81 cm) sold at auction, Pairs, Dec.
  12, 1989, # 81, as atelier of Jan Brueghel the Younger.</li><li>A poor copy attributed
  to Jan Brueghel the Younger with tulip (102.5 x 67 cm), Galerie d''Art St. Honore,
  2005</li><li>A very good copy by Jan Brueghel the Younger (panel, 64 x 48 cm), shown
  in 1960 exhibition, "Bloem en tuin" Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent, #30.</li><li>Copy
  on the art market, Los Angeles (panel, 98 x 70.5)</li></ul><p>It is interesting
  to note that these copies are sometimes of very different sizes.</p><p>Brenninkmeijer-de
  Rooij suggests that this is the painting mentioned in a letter of March 25, 1611,
  from Brueghel to Bianchi: he says that he has embarked upon a large painting "with
  surely a thousand flowers...."</p>'
