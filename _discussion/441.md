comment: "<p>Attribution of figures is uncertain. K. Renger believes them to be the
  work of a collaborator, possibly Rottenhammer, but I have examined this work and
  believe that the figures are probably the work of Jan himself. Particularly Joseph
  is a quintessential Jan figure. Neumeister now thinks that they could be the work
  of a studio assistant in Jan's studio, which is more possible than Rottenhammer
  but still not in my opinion necessary. </p><p>Related to Ertz 1979 #71 (2008-10
  #209), The Sacrifice of Isaac.</p><p>Related to drawing also in Munich, Staatliche
  Graphische Sammlung #1362 Z (old number 730).</p><p>Mirjam Neumeister suggests (personal
  communication) that this could be an instance of a work where Jan semi-completed
  a picture as a version of another work and later completed it, with the figures,
  when a buyer wanted a certain type of picture. So in this case the present, secondary
  picture would have been initiated at the same time as the Geneva Sacrifice of Isaac
  of ca. 1600 and completed, perhaps by Jan's studio, at a later date.</p>"
