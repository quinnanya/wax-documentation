comment: '<p>Was engraved by Cornelis van Dalen the Younger, probably before 1648,
  without Jan''s garland (See Schuckman 1995, "Hollstein" V., #23).</p><p>According
  to Van Mulders, Rubens kept this painting himself until 1624 when it went to Prince
  Wadislas of Poland and then to the Duke of Buckingham.</p><p>The garland in this
  picture is reused on collaborations between Jan and Van Balen. Although no drawing
  for this garland survives, the one that does (Antwerp, Plantin-Moretus, inv. D.IX.23)
  confirms (unsurprisingly) that Janâ€™s garlands were meant to be replicated using
  detailed drawn studies.</p>'
