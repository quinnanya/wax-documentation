comment: '<p>This painting is part of a series of the five sense completed between
  1617-1618. Please also see:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-touch">The
  Sense of Touch</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-sight">The Sense of

  href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-taste">The Sense of Taste</a></li></ul><p>A variation
  of this with the same central figures reconfigured attributed to Jan Brueghel the
  Younger (panel, 57.2 x 88 cm) sold London, Sotheby''s, Jul 10, 2002, #49. A signed
  copy of this variation by JBII ("J. Breugel") with a clothed nymph (copper, 59.3
  x 90.2 cm) sold London, Christie''s, Dec. 13, 2000 #8.<br />Good copy sold London
  (Christie''s 22.iv.88 #61), panel, 68.3 x 113:  in this one, according to the catalogue,
  the castle of Mariemont is mysteriously shown without the extensions begun in 1608:  those
  extensions are shown in the original. How could that have happened?  Also in this
  copy the inscription on music stand with A & I''s names is lacking.   This is only
  copy in which main figure is nude; why?   She looks like she might be by Van Balen,
  as does the putto, Van Balen trying kind of to imitate Rubens but not trying very
  hard.<br />Another version is attributed by Ertz to Jan the Younger.  It''s part
  of series of 5 full copies:  Jan the Younger, cat. #180, panel, 68.5 x 112.  In
  it Mariemont is in its extended state.<br />A copy with a clothed nymph (panel,
  66 x 108 cm), sold at auction in Vienna (J.C. von Klinkoseh), April 2, 1889, #27.
  Part of a series, see discussion for <a href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-touch">The
  Sense of Touch</a>. Another with a clothed main figure on art market in 1941:  panel,
  31 x 48 in.   Another really bad one, with many simplifications for an incompetent
  copyist, sold Paris (Charpentier 3.xii.57),  panel, 75 x 115.<br />Diaz Padron identifies
  the central figure as Venus although Speth-Holterhoff had called her Euterpe.<br
  />Picture of Orpheus on back wall is related to much earlier work by Jan, currently
  in French private collection and dated 1600 (Ertz 2008-10 #378, my 00020). Query
  did Jan still have drawing for that earlier work or how did he reconstruct it.</p><p>The
  landscape seen from the window here in repeated in the painting of Taste, Touch,
  and Hearing (Ertz 1979 #333).</p>'
