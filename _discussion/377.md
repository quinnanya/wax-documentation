comment: "<p>This has been attributed as a collaboration with Rottenhammer before
  and is at the RKD under Rottenhammer, but it is now accepted by Werche as having
  figures by Van Balen.<br />Jan's role is quite substantial in this work: the landscape,
  the whole background history with all its figures, the animals, sll by Jan. Werche
  says that it's all by Van Balen but she had not seen a good reproduction.<br />Ertz,
  p.479, says that Jan did the landscape first and then gave the painting to Van Balen
  to fill in the figures; if this is true, it would reverse the order of working that
  he had used for instance with Rottenhammer.<br />This work was displayed in Maastricht
  at TEFAF in 2005.</p>"
