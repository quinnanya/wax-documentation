comment: "<p>Hard to judge from auction house photo but figures aren't actually that
  good.  In fact, this is a completely lifeless and boring work.  The colors are nice
  but I can't believe it's autograph.  the fact that there are various copies argues
  that somehow the composition originated in his workshop. There is a copy of this
  one in the Prado, another in Belfast, and a lesser variant by some follower in the
  DVRK.</p>"
