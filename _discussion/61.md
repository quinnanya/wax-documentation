comment: <p>Ertz had attributed these to Brueghel, Rubens, and Snyders. Others agree,
  though, that Snyders was not involved in this or (probably) any other collaboration
  with Brueghel.</p><p>Díaz Padrón argued that all the paintings seen here were executed
  by Francken, except for the "Dentist." He also points out that the largest painting
  in the room is a version, by Francken, of the Antwerp Visit by Minerva to Helicon.
  </p><p>For more on this pair of paintings see under the Allegory of Sight and Smell.</p>
