comment: '<p>The Rome "Allegory of Air" is part of a series of the elements which
  Jan Brueghel painted between 1606-1611, now in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj. See
  Also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-earth-rome">Allegory of Earth
  (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-water-rome">Allegory of Water
  (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-fire-venus-in-the-forge-of-vulcan-rome">Allegory
  of Fire: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan (Rome)</a></li></ul><p>The dating on this
  work has been based on comparison to the Lyon Allegory of Air of 1611, but Rikken
  and Smith point out that the animals in this picture are less sophisticated than
  those in the Lyon work and suggest an earlier date, perhaps closer to 1608. I would
  suggest that this is one of those cases when establishing a perfect sequence is
  unhelpful, and that possibly both works were initiated together and then completed
  at different times by different hands in the workshop.</p>'
