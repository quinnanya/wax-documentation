comment: "<p>First attributed by Pijl. When exhibited in Worcester it was attributed
  to Bril with figures by Jan, which is understandable (the surface is a little hard
  and pastey for Jan) but not likely. The dating to ca. 1593 is at Pijl's suggestion
  as well, by comparison to Ertz 1979 #4 of 1594.<br />There is a painting sold Sotheby's
  NY December 29 2009 #10 as a JB that is, i think, a version of these but very very
  small--11.6 x 16.6, and on copper.  I don't think the faces of the hunters here
  are convincing as JB.  They say it's on a copper plate by Peeter Stas which would
  make it a work (or a studio variant, more) from Jan's Antwerp period.</p>"
