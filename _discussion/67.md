comment: "<p>Copy of this in Stuttgart, WÃ¼rttembergische Staatsgalerie, 1931 cat.
  #590 (copper, 46 x 67).  The Stuttgart series is a direct copy after the Borromeo
  series but made when that group was complete and together, ie., when it was at the
  Ambrosiana between 1618 and Napolean.  Set of copies also sold Christies, London,
  20 or 26.vi.70 #50 (copper, 47 x 66).  Only 2 are illustrated on page at RKD but
  they are clearly after this series. </p><p>There is a drawing formerly in the collection
  Van Regteren Altena in Amstedam that is related to this; published by Winner 1972,
  p. 142, fig. 21.  It must represent an early idea for the picture but there have
  been many changes.</p>"
