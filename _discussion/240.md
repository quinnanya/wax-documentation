comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue nor the Honig Database.</p><p>It
  was displayed at TEFAF in Maastricht in 2005.</p><p>The composition clearly derives
  from Pieter Bruegel the Elder's drawing <em>Stream with an Angler</em> of ca. 1554
  (Brussels, Biblliotheque Royale de Belgique, Cabinet des Estampes; 34.5 x 23.5).
  There are a number of copies of that drawing which the author of this painting might
  have known.</p>"
