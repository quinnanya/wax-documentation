comment: '<p>A very large version of this composition (canvas, 155.3 x 256)  attributed
  to Martin van Cleve was with Johnny van Haeften in 2015. His catalogue suggests
  that Van Cleve''s version is a "missing link" between Pieter the Elder''s version
  and those of his sons. I would wonder, rather, how Van Cleve got access to whatever
  studio materials were used for producing this work. This "Van Cleve" work was formerly
  attributed to Pieter the Younger (Ertz 2000, cat. #A830).</p>'
