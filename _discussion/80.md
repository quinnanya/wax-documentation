comment: '<p>British Museum website on describing <a href="/janbrueghel/roman-ruins-possibly-the-colosseum">Roman
  Ruins, Possibly the Colosseum</a>: "Very similar drawings, showing Roman ruins (possibly
  showing the Colosseum) and executed in the same loose style and with the same application
  of the wash, are signed and inscribed by Jan Brueghel. Two sheets in the Museum
  Boijmans-Van Beuningen (inv.nos.3-4) are authentically inscribed "Roma" and "1593"
  or "1595". A third drawing in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin (inv.no.26327, bought
  at Sotheby''s, 26 November 1970) is signed "Brueghel"."</p>'
