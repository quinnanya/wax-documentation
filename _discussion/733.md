comment: "<p>Has been dated to ca.1594 which would make it one of Brueghel's earliest
  works. Although the copper support and dimensions are identical with those of Brueghel's
  works done in Italy, it is difficult to fit this picture (and others related to
  it, like Ertz 1979 #4) with the spatial feeling of his Italian-period history pictures.
  Ertz and others make connection (correctly) to his father's Magpie on the Gallows,
  which was owned by Jan's mother having been left to her by Pieter Bruegel. The connections
  are in fact so close that it is hard to imagine this being done in Italy, without
  access to the original painting -- even a drawing would have had to be very close
  indeed. Also, this is a very sophisticated work in comparison with those little
  rocky coastline works that were supposed to be his first landscapes, kind of dramatic
  difference. There is definitely not, as M. Hale has suggested, any link to Flight
  into Egypt iconography.</p>"
