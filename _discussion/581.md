comment: <p>Note on the back of RKD photo says that this painting is after a drawing
  by Hendrick Vroom. It does seem very odd that the ships here are flying the flag
  of the Dutch provinces (which had been toward the beginning of the revolt). The
  format is related to a Frans Huys engraving after Pieter the Elder from 1595, although
  the ship is different.</p><p>I think that this might be the "Marina con alcune navi
  di mano di Bruculo" that was in the collection of Cardinal del Monte, one of Brueghel's
  key Roman patrons. Although its date is after Jan's return to Antwerp, I believe
  that he continued supplying his Italian patrons with works from there -- we know
  this is true for Borommeo, of course. This work's provenance goes back to the Barberini
  family and they acquired many items from Del Monte's collection in the 17th century.</p>
