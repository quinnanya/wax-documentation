comment: "<p>This must be the last of the three Colonna hell scenes. The architecture
  of the landscape, including the greatly expanded cavern in the lower right, relates
  to the later classical underworlds Jan would paint in Antwerp, and the collaboration
  with Rottenhammer suggests a later date as well. Ertz thinks that this work was
  executed by Jan alone but he had not examined the original, from which it is clear
  that there are two hands at work. The two artists used Albrecht Dürer's The Harrowing
  of Hell, or Christ in Limbo from the Engraved Passion; B.16, as the basis for their
  composition. Jan adapted the German master’s demons for those closest to hell’s
  gates, although the other devils come very much from his own repertoire.</p>"
