comment: '<p>British Museum website: "A similar group of figures can be seen in the
  painting ''Path along a Brook'' in Schloß Schleißheim (part of the Staatsgemäldesammlungen).
  The female figure offering a drink can also be seen in ''Landscape with a Village
  Inn'' in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, inv.no.826. It is not clear if this drawing
  is a preparatory study, or rather copied from one of the paintings.Literature: K.
  Ertz, "Jan Brueghel der Ältere: Die Gemälde", Cologne, 1979, cat.nos. 206 and 290;
  A. Van Camp, in M. Neumeister (ed.), "Breughel: Gemälde von Jan Brueghel d. Ä",
  exh.cat. Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 2013, cat.no.67."</p>'
