comment: "<p>The Honig Database has tentatively attributed this painting to the Studio
  of Jan Brueghel the Elder.<br />Ertz states that this picture is dated by 1612 but
  in fact there is no date on it. A copy of this work in a private collection is indeed
  dated 1612: private collection, New York, 1979 (panel, 18 x 28); not in Ertz. That
  copy was probably once in the Leuchtenberg Collection, Munich, cat. #107 n 1852.
  A much larger variant on canvas was sold in Berlin, March 12 1935, #155 (canvas,
  75 x 128).<br />There is no real reason to think that this work was originally intended
  as a pendant of the other Samuel Collection Brueghel (Ertz 1979 #259).</p>"
