comment: '<p>Possibly, like the Zurich Flood with Noah''s Ark, a picture originally
  executed for Benedetto Guistiniani: this is the only surviving autograph work by
  Brueghel that matches a subject listed in his inventory at this date, of this size
  ("uno del Giuditio"). See Discussion page for the Zurich painting for more details.
  </p><p>A version of this is in Copenhagen, Statens Museum, # KMSsp180.  It was in
  their Kunstkammer by 1690; is in that inventory.   It''s also on copper, 27.5 x
  36, and is dated 1602 (too late for the Giustiniani inventory).   Their catalog
  calls it a studio replica of this picture.  Both, they say, are based on a Rottenhammer
  painting in Munich, dated Venice 1598, which however is an upright format.  Ertz
  does not mention the Copenhagen work in his new catalogue but he does illustrate
  a version sold Sotheby''s London December 6 2007 #151 (copper, 27.8 x 36.7, signed
  & dated 1607), which has a Peter Stas mark on the plate.  He says it might be original
  but it was correctly (to my mind) sold as a copy; it looks like a rather weak studio
  version from Ertz''s illustration. </p><p>When this was sold in 1953 it had with
  it a Hell scene (Ertz mistakenly says that it was sold with the Zurich Noah''s Ark).
  the Hell scene was of the same dimensions and also dated 1601. </p><p>Copenhagen
  painting published as JBI in Hanne Kolind Poulsen and Henrik Holm, Nature Strikes
  Back (Copenhagen, Statens Museum, 2009), fig. 74, 136-138</p><p>If the 1601 version
  was indeed sent to Giustiniani immediately upon its completion, then either the
  other two were based on a full pattern drawing or, more likely, they were all begun
  at the same time in Jan''s studio and finished off when buyers wanted them. </p><p>The
  Rottenhammer picture on which all three of Jan''s paintings are closely based is
  dated 1598 and is documented in Antwerp ca. 1626 by its appearance in the Gallery
  of COrnelis van der Gheest; but clearly it had come to Antwerp almost  immediately
  upon its completion because Jan knew either it or a drawing of it by 1601. Since
  Jan and Rottenhammer were friends, I suspect that the former served as an agent/mediator
  in getting this work into the hands of an Antwerp patron.</p>'
