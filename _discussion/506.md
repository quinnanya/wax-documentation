comment: <p>A very early larger-scale work; indeed, exceptionally large for this period.
  The other religious histories from this time are at most about a quarter of this
  size and often much smaller. Only the classical battle scenes from these years are
  of such large scale.<br />Good copy in Stockholm, Nationalmuseum (panel, 82 x 121),
  signed and dated 1606. </p><p>According to Louisa Wood Ruby, "Jan used the motif
  of the Tomb of Scipio in numerous compositions, including two works in the exhibition,
  [this] wonderful painting in Munich dated 1598 and the drawing of a <a href="/janbrueghel/harbor-with-a-fish-market">Harbor
  with a Fish Market</a> in a private collection.  In examining possible motivations
  for the frequency of the appearance of the Tomb of Scipio motif in Janâ€™s oeuvre,
  a recent analysis convincingly suggests that its inclusion was meant to appeal to
  Neo-Stoic patrons in both Rome and later Antwerp, who would have understood and
  appreciated its reference to the Neo-Stoic ideal."</p>
