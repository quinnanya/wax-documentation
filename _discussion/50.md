comment: "<p>Many of the vessels here bear legible inscriptions relating to alchemical
  work: I could read Magiscana Perlaram, Sal Momia, Mercuria Coralatus fe, Aqua Paradiso
  & others. Of all the works in the Four Elements series, this is the one that is
  clearly about man-made things (not nature) and in particular its theme seems to
  be transformation and artifice. Apart from the money and the weapons, which are
  in the center, the two sides each treat means of transformation, what we would call
  mechanical on left and chemical on right.  The kunstkammer-ish collection on left
  seems to have an unusual number of tools in it--lots of little tools for hand crafts,
  the tools that are used in various ways to make the vessels that are also shown.
  \ Pliers and hammers and various things that grasp or saw; there are more of those
  in with the weapons. Copy in Paris, Louvre, inv. #4007 (copper, 47 x 68); copy Stuttgart,
  Wurttembergische Staatsgalerie,1931 cat. #613 (copper, 46 x 67). This image/series
  was replicated less often than the Lyons and Doria Pamphili ones, but there are
  indeed some copies.</p>"
