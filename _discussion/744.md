comment: "<p>From the Dorotheum's online auction details:</p><blockquote><p>We are
  grateful to Klaus Ertz for confirming the attribution after examination of the painting
  in the original (written communication, March 2015).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz
  writes: “The present painting can be said to have survived in good condition. The
  paints, applied in the impasto technique, still give a jewel-like and brilliant
  impression, while the overlapping, translucent glazes are excellently preserved.
  The copper plate is one of the thick and heavy types produced in the early 17th
  century […]. When compared to the ‘world landscapes’ of the 16th century, the approach
  to reality in the present picture has fundamentally changed. Different from the
  art of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, for example, here the beholder no longer looks
  down on a scene set far below, but metaphorically speaking almost enters the picture’s
  space. Nevertheless Jan Brueghel the Elder maintains the distance between the spectator
  and the composition by still choosing a slightly raised vantage point. At the same
  time, the artist ‘narrates’ episodes from contemporary everyday village life, such
  as the conversation between villagers, animals moving about freely, figures attending
  to horses, and the loading and unloading of barges. These ‘story-telling’ village
  landscapes number among the artist’s most advanced and pioneering compositions,
  which he started tackling around 1605. They can generally be assigned to the genre
  of ‘village scenes by a river’, which involves the peculiar combination of two themes
  of landscape painting that also existed individually: the village landscape and
  the river landscape. In this painting, the 16th century’s rigid division into the
  three colours of brown, green, and blue has been entirely overcome. Spatial depth
  is now merely accentuated by zones of light and shade and, of course, by the canal,
  which orthogonally extends into the background. Foreground, midground, and background
  seamlessly blend into one another.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz compares
  the present painting to the following works by Jan Brueghel I, all of which are
  closely related to it in terms of composition and painterly handling:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1.
  Village Scene with a Forge (Pushkin Museum, Moscow, signed and dated 1603);<br />2.
  Village Road (Alte Pinakothek, Munich, signed and dated 1610);<br />3. Village Landscape
  with a Canal (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan, signed and dated 16.7);<br />4. Village
  Road with a Canal (private collection, signed and dated 1609)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ertz
  continues: “Like the present painting, the works by Jan Brueghel the Elder mentioned
  above belong to the landscape type of ‘wide river landscape’. The beholder’s eye
  wanders across the picture and its spatiality as a whole without ‘getting stuck’.
  Horizontals dominate over verticals, although the row of houses on the right-hand
  side still betrays vertical tendencies, which would play a role in the painter’s
  work throughout his career as a formal and compositional means to organise the two-dimensional
  surface of the picture. In terms of chronology, the painting to be assessed here
  must be assigned to approximately the period in which the comparative examples mentioned
  above were made. Given the development of Flemish landscape painting in general
  and the similarities between the aforementioned compositions and the present painting
  in particular, the latter seems to date from the mid-1610s.”</p></blockquote>"
