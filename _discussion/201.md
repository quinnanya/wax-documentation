comment: '<p>Information from British Museum website: Copy after Pieter Bruegel''s
  drawing in Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, inv.no.5763. Another sheet in Berlin (inv.no.13214)
  seems to be a copy after the BM sheet. The inscription on the back of the drawing
  probably refers to the title on the Berlin sheet "Basrode" (Baasrode near Dendermonde
  in Belgium)."</p>'
