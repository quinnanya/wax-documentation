comment: "<p>variant on panel, 45 x 72, sold New York (Kende 10.xi.45 #16)<br />At
  TEFAF, Maastricht, 1997<br />Figures in this are not really that good but I suspect
  that is due to its very small size -- in that regard, this is an ambitiously complex
  work. Wonder about its relation to 2 small coppers (about same size?) in Munich
  -- possibly all parts of set ordered by A&I?</p>"
