comment: <p>There are five versions of this composition attributed with varying degrees
  of closeness to Jan/circle of Jan. Sellink feels that the present version is the
  best one. He says that Boon also accepted its attribution to Jan even though he
  catalogs it as "school of Pieter Bruegel."</p>
