comment: <p>A very Momper-ish landscape (as noted also by Diaz Padron) and yet the
  figures are more deeply, fully embedded in the place than they are when added into
  a Momper as staffage. They are done in a softer, more painterly manner than those
  in his collaborations.  It's as if here Jan is feeling out what a landscape would
  be like if they didn't collaborate, but he did it all on his own. Background has
  less fussy details than in a Momper, more a vague sense that "here there is detail"
  but there isn't. Which is actually what Momper does but Jan here does it more. A
  great contrast to the collaborative works here in Madrid.</p>
