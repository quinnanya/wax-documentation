comment: "<p>Although the BM catalogs this as Jan after Pieter, in fact it is an original
  composition using various motifs from a range of works by Pieter, produced in the
  period when Jan was coming to terms with Pieter's legacy. See too Currie and Allart
  on the series of Peasant Wedding Dance compositions.</p>"
