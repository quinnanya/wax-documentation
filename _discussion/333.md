comment: "<p>The hermit reappears in Ertz 1979 #21, Landscape with Hermit on Right.
  That is, however, a work that Honig considers a doubtful attribution. Copy in Prague,
  National Gallery, Inv. $DO 5082 (copper, 26 x 35.3).</p><p>Ertz notes that various
  motifs here, like table and chairs, are derived from a drawing by Cornelis van Dalem
  in the Staedel, Frankfurt, Inv. #763. Question is how Jan could have known that.</p>"
