comment: "<p>Figures of demons seem more Bosch-like here than in other works by Jan,
  eg. the pig-faced demon armed with a sword. Not same as Bosch but perhaps knowledge
  of a common source? Other demonic forms seem to echo Durer. Except for the woman,
  none of the tempters is fully human. The paint in this work is very fine.</p>"
