comment: '<p>According to Louisa Wood Ruby, "the man with the tall hat facing left
  in the foreground of this drawing is a replica of the figure in the <a href="harbor-scene-paris">Harbor
  Scene (Paris)</a>. All of the men have their cloaks wrapped closely around them
  as if against the damp, beggars stare vacantly out at the viewer, and various women
  and children are scattered throughout the composition: these are the earliest renditions
  of what would become stock figural types for Jan."</p>'
