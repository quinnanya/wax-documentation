comment: "<p>Werche (2004, A.45) accepts this attribution by van Balen and Jan Brueghel
  but also notes that it is very closely related to another painting by Hendrick van
  Balen and Jan Brueghel the Younger (Werche, A.44).  The Honig Database rejects this
  attribution. The painting is, however, may be a collaborative work between Jan Brueghel
  the Younger and Van Balen in their later years.</p>"
