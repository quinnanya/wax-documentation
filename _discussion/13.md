comment: '<p>This seems to be the prime version of a composition of which there are
  several further copies, eg the painting sold Christies London July 7 2004, and the
  version in Munich (ertz 1979 #26). It is also possible that the Munich version is
  the prime one. All are on copper plates of roughly the same size but only this one
  is signed and dated. It was sold as having a pendant of Aeneas and Sibyl in the
  Underworld, a work that seems to be later and of slightly less good quality. Perhaps
  they were put together later as being thematically connected.</p><p>Many actual
  sites from Rome can be identified in "Troy" here.  Although I have not seen this
  picture, I suggest that its date might actually read 1595 because the drawing on
  which it is based is very clearly dated 1594. That drawing is View of the Bridge
  and Castel Sant'' Angelo (pen and brown ink, 179 x 269); Darmstadt, Hessisches Landesmuseum,
  inv. #AE 397. On this drawing see Winner 1975, 93-94.</p>'
