comment: "<p>Another related work which has been said to be Jan Brueghel copying after
  Rottenhammer is a pictures sold in Cologne, Lempertz, November 25, 2000, #1120 (copper,
  33 x 48.5); this one is illustrated in Borggrefe 2008, p.125, fig. 176. At least
  one actual collaboration between Jan and Rottenhammer must exist, probably the Munich/Augsburg
  picture, if Jan & studio were also producing further variants. </p><p>The present
  picture is, according to Werche, an authentic Van Balen from some time after 1620.
  According to her, Ertz had communicated to her that the collaborator was Jan the
  Younger although it is now included in the Jan the Elder book. </p><p>There is a
  copy of this in Antwerp, KMSK, also very large (100 x 218) and on canvas.</p>"
