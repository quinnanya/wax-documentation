comment: "<p>Although scholars have suggested that the original design for this work
  was Jan’s, or even Pieter the Younger's I believe that Jan was using materials from
  his father’s studio that had been developed around 1564, the date of Pieter the
  Elder’s Dormition of the Virgin which shares a similarly constructed interior space.
  Since the Dormition was in grisaille, perhaps the original Visit was as well, or
  perhaps the similar space of the Dormition (which was still in Antwerp, and owned
  by Ortelius) gave him the idea to paint the Visit in that medium. But the latter
  was certainly not Jan’s invention: the relative scale of the figures, their often
  hidden faces, and the fascination with commonplace objects and habits are all Pieter
  the Elder’s manner and uncharacteristic of Jan’s work.</p>"
