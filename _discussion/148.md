comment: "<p>I question this attribution because 1) its actually odd to have a work
  that relates to no other one; and 2) the dying tree doesn't seem like Jan.  Also,
  the attribution is based partly on a drawing, ostensibly dated 1610, which even
  Ertz has as a questionable attribution.  I'd feel better if Winner had accepted
  it [check that]. The same staffage is reused in a work in Enschede that  Ertz attributes
  to Jan the Younger and Momper, making me think that this drawing was some sort of
  pattern to be copied. There are some things really wrong with this drawing (proportions
  of cows) although to be fair they do not occur in the present painting.</p>"
