comment: "<p>This is a picture with many, many copies and variants, photos at the
  RKD. However, the only other one that even might be an original, in my opinion,
  is Ertz #108. That is a tiny copper version of the present rather large one on panel.
  Would be interesting to consider how all these versions were being produced in the
  workshop.</p>"
