comment: '<p>the animals relate to those in Jan''s early paradise landscapes, particularly
  the Louvre <em>Earth</em> painted for Borromeo in 1608. It does not relate at all
  to the later paradise paintings. If this is by Jan, it must date to around 1608.
  Ir cannot possibly be by Jan the Younger (why would he have been using things from
  a decade earlier by his dad?) so I would think it''s by an artist working around
  1608 who has access to Jan''s drawings or his Louvre (then Milan) painting. The
  arrangement of the animals is not like Jan and more like Frans II Pourbus; cf. painting
  in Pitti. </p><p>Copy sold Versailles, June 2, 1965 #152 (panel, 38 x 50.5) as attributed
  to Jan the Elder.</p><p>If this was the painting in la Granja in 1746, it was described
  as "Un país original en tabla de Abel Brueghel, el Paraiso Terrenal entregando Eva
  el pomo vedado a Adán de un terco y unos dedos de alto y media vara y cuatro de
  ancho.”</p>'
