comment: <p>An autograph version of this painting exists in Vienna (<a href="/janbrueghel/flowers-in-earthenware-vase-vienna">Flowers
  in Earthenware Vase (Vienna)</a>. There are slight variations in composition between
  the two works; this version most obviously lacks the ring and gold coins in Vienna
  version. Also note that the Vienna painting is neither signed nor dated.<br />There
  is another variant in Florence that has been attributed to Jan the Younger.</p>
