comment: "<p>Copy in St. Petersburg: oil on panel, 48 x 67, inv. #2446; photo at RKD,
  box L6 as by Jan the Elder. Ertz has attributed that work to Jan the Younger (Ertz
  1984, cat. #23); surely it is in fact simply a studio version of the present work.
  </p><p>There is the mark of Pieter Stas with the date 1610 on the back of the copper
  panel.</p>"
