comment: '<p>This painting is a variant of <a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-the-four-elements-vienna">Allegory
  of the Four Elements (Vienna)</a> (See HDB; Ertz 2008-10, p 1084).<br />Diaz Padron
  dates this painting to the first decade of the seventeenth century.<br />A very
  good exact copy of this, also on panel and just slightly larger, was sold in Paris
  (Pal. Gall. 21.iii.77 #43); another copy, again on panel and of roughly the same
  size, was sold in London (Christieâ€™s 10.xii.93 #10). Still another version accepted
  as autograph by Ertz is his 1979 #301. There are numerous weaker copies and variants
  as well, like one sold Christie''s New York 4.vi.86 #112 and one sold London (Christie''s
  19.vi.87 #21).<br />A copy attributed to Jan Brueghel the Younger is also in the
  Prado.</p>'
