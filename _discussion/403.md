comment: "<p>There has been much disagreement about the attribution of both figures
  and landscape. The earliest London catalogue (1904) attributed the figures to Rottenhammer.
  Hendrick de Clerck has also been suggested. Ertz has wavered between attributing
  the landscape to Jan the Elder or the Younger. Werche says that the figures are
  Van Balen in around 1605-08 (which is also what Jost thought) so Jan the Younger
  cannot have done the landscape; it would be by Jan the Elder and/or his studio.</p>"
