comment: "<p>A painting whose description precisely matches this work was reported
  in an 18th-century guidebook as hanging in the sacristy of the Milan Cathedral:
  see Brown, “Hans Rottenhammer in Rom,” 31. According to the 18th-century guidebook
  the copy was used as an ex-voto; it was sized to the original Ghisi print, like
  the Del Monte painting, but was on wood panel rather than copper. My hypothesis
  would be that this painting was a copy by Jan (probably still with Rottenhammer)
  of their particularly ambitious and complex commissioned painting, and was  sold
  shortly after its execution to a buyer in Milan.</p>"
