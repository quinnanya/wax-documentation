comment: "<p>Ertz lists as possibly autograph one formerly with T. Engell, London
  (1979 catalog #348). Judging from the photo (which is also all that Ertz has seen)
  that painting is very weak, not even near Jan Brueghel.  Panel 33 x 43.5. A perfectly
  good version is Ertz 1979 #263 in The Hague, DVRK, sig. & d. 1612..  Thus these
  two are dated five years apart. I would guess that this was one of those cases where
  paintings were begun at the same time and then one version left not entirely finished
  until it had a buyer, at which time it was completed and dated.<br />Another horribly
  wooden version sold Vienna (Dorotheum) 11.iii.80 #152 as Vrancx & Jan the Younger
  (panel, 35.5 x 53.5).  An even less good version sold Brussles, Amédée Prouvost
  20.vi.28 #106 (canvas, 41 x 48); and an extremely lousy version sold London (Sotheby
  xi.59).  Is that same as one with Brian Koetser, London, 1972 (panel, 30.8 x 45)?</p>"
