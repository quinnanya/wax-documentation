comment: '<p>But in point of fact all of those other sets are more closely related
  to the Lyons version of Earth than to this one. I don''t know if that is an argument
  for its priority or just an indication that is was more available for imitation
  somehow and at some time. In the RKD file Voorordening/Elements/Earth there are
  many photographs of versions and variants of varying degrees of quality. Some go
  under title "Allegory of Abundance" or some such. I wonder if they were originally
  painted as part of a series or if they were produced as independent works. Some
  are remarkably awful and very distant; I''d put some maybe in 18th century. They
  develop a completely different landscape feeling and all sorts of different landscape
  variations: a different castle in distance, or a scene of harvest in the fields.
  They do relate to both of the variants, Lyons and DP, but more to Lyons.</p>'
