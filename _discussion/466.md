comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue nor the Honig Database.</p><p>There
  is the mark of Pieter Stas on the back of the copper panel as well as the hand of
  Antwerp.</p><p>The character of this scene is reminiscent of the river Scheldt as
  it passes though the Flemish countryside on its gradual course toward Antwerp and
  the North Sea. The large Church dominating the horizon in the distance is recognizable
  as the Antwerp Cathedral.</p>"
