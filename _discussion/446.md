comment: '<p>A weak version of this was on the art market in Vienna (Dorotheum 1972,
  copper, 23.5 x 31); it repeats the Hague painting (see related works). It was sold
  at Sotheby''s London April 11, 1990 #38 as Jan Brueghel II and Van Balen.</p><p>There
  is a letter at the Rubenianum from L. Burchard about this painting, dated January
  6, 1947. He thinks it is identical to a painting described by Carlo Ridolfi in his
  Maraviglie dell'' Arte (Venice 1648, II, p. 76). Ridolfi says it is by Rottenhammer,
  on copper, and that he has seen it in Verona in the collection of somebody called
  Muselli. "... in oltre un inventione della Virgine, la quale passanda nell'' Egitto,
  dede in una boscaglia & allata di pargoletto Giesu, a cui un Angelo porge un canestrino
  di fiori.."  Burchard notes that there is no basket in this painting but says that
  Ridolfi''s descriptions are sometimes wrong. </p><p>An precise replication of a
  drawing by Bril now in the Louvre.</p>'
