comment: "<p>Other scholars had dated this to before 1600 but Ertz, citing Winner,
  says that there are motives in this painting that Jan must have picked up in Prague
  in 1604, in particular some buildings in the background city of Jerusalem. The subject
  is peculiar.  Zoege von Manteuffel has identified this scene as one when Christ
  answers questions from some apostles about fate of Jerusalem:  Mark 13:3 ff.  I
  find this the most convincing explanation, but for the debate see Ertz 2008-10,
  p.580.</p>"
