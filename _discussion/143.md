comment: "<p>I suspect that this must date a bit later than Ertz puts it, perhaps
  late 1590s. The shape and support would be incredibly aberrant for a Roman work,
  and most of the Roman works stayed for quite some time in Italy. </p><p>Related
  drawings in Albertina, inv. #8424 (doubted, I think, by Winner?) and Groningen,
  Museum voor Stadenlande, Inv. #1951-600.</p>"
