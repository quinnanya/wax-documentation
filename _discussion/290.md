comment: "<p>There are numerous larger copies of this tiny work.  Two that I reject
  are Ertz 1979 #s 284 and 285. Another  version, not bad (better than 284!) but not
  genuine, sold Brussels, Palais des Beaux-Arts, 28.x.58 #451 (panel, 40 x 60);  good
  photo of that at RKD.  It was expertised by Friedl√§nder in 1958 as Jan the Elder.
  A poor copy in Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, 17 x 28.5 in.<br />In the present work,
  a lot of figures are heavily drawn but not very filled in, and the brushwork is
  not lively. However, in very small works like this it's hard to judge.</p>"
