comment: "<p>This work is very closely related to version in the Colonna collection.
  Possibly a contemporary autograph copy that Jan took back to Antwerp and formed
  the basis of further variants executed there; or could this be the one listed in
  Giustiniani inventory in 1601? I also find it very possible that all the Magi paintings
  were executed in Antwerp, where the theme is local and the visual materials to hand,
  and then sent to patrons in Rome (as he was doing for Borromeo). But if any versions
  were executed in Rome they are this and the Colonna painting.</p>"
