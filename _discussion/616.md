comment: '<p>A high quality painting with a garland based closely on this one was
  sold in London (Sotheby''s 6.xii.2006 #6), canvas, 163 x 137.  The London painting
  has little narrative medallions planted in the garland with scenes from the life
  of the Virgin.  It was sold as Jan Brueghel the Younger  collaborating with Van
  Balen; it''s not published anywhere else and could certainly be a studio production.</p><p>This
  is probably the painting described by Brueghel in a letter to Bianchi of September
  5, 1621: "the most beautiful and rare thing I have ever done in my life. Rubens
  too has well demonstrated his talent in the painting in the middle, which is a most
  beautiful Madonna. the birds and the animals are made from life from some [owned
  by] the Infanta. I think that the charm [vagagessa] and [diligenza] used in this
  work will please your Eminence." Eventually Jan received 300 scudi for this and
  Rubens received a gold coin. Freedberg feels that this correspondence refers instead
  to the painting now in the Prado, although it does not have a provenance to the
  Borromeo collection and the present work definitely does. Jones agrees with Freedberg
  on this question. </p><p>Freedberg points out that a version of this appears in
  the 1617 Sense of Sight as a larger painting. This does not mean (as he speculates)
  that a larger version ever really existed, but it does mean that the composition
  must have originated by 1617 even though Jan was flogging this to Borromeo four
  years later. So perhaps Ertz''s earlier dating is correct.</p>'
