comment: <p>A very exact studio copy of Ertz 223. Outlining of figures rather heavy
  and the brushwork, where visible, not as lively; but it's basically quite good.  Entry
  in Sotheby's catalogue records Ertz's wavering about this work. He called it Jan
  the Elder in 1979, then reattributed to Jan the Younger in 1994 (claiming that Jan
  the Younger had 'predated' it).  Now, in 2004, he was calling it a "collaborative
  work between Jan the Elder and his studio!"  because parts are of a level of "refinement
  and brilliance that indicate the hand of Jan the Elder."  In the Cremona catalogue
  Ertz said it was Jan the Elder.  Sotheby's admitted that there were weak parts but
  they were "by an artist in his studio, working under his direction."  Then they
  backed down again and said that maybe it was a leftover in the studio when Jan the
  Younger came back from Italy and he completed it then, in 1625. In my opinion this
  is a nice studio work generated contemporaneously with Ertz 223, possibly finished
  a few years later.</p>
