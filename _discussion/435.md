comment: <p>Ertz dated this much later than Neumeister does. He called it 1606-11,
  whereas she says that the landscape looks ore like Jan's style and coloration from
  around 1600. Query what documentation we have of Jan & Rottenhammer collaborating
  as late as 1610-11, when Jan was surely working mostly with local artists.<br />Note
  that the size of this copper plate differs from Jan's "usual" and that it must have
  originated in the workshop of Rottenhammer. The copper plate is however a reused
  one; it seems to have been originally used for an engraving of some sort.</p>
