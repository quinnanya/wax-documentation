comment: "<p>This painting corresponds very close to a engraving of Aegidius Sadeler
  after a design by Roelandt Savery (c. 164 x 220 mm, Illustrated Bartsch, 72/01,
  p. 22, no. 227 ). Both, print and painting, shows the same direction with light
  from left below.  The branches and leaves differ in details. The painting could
  be the original by Savery or a good copy after the print. The engraving belongs
  to a series of six, done in Prague without dating. The collaboration between Savery
  and Aegidius Sadeler started in all probability in 1609, but I guess, that this
  series of print by Sadeler, to which this print belongs, was created few years later,
  around 1611 or 1612, see Bartilla, Stefan, Roelandt Savery Inventor. In: Kotková,
  Olga (ed.), Roelandt Savery, Malíř ve službách císaře Rudolfa II. – A Painter in
  the Services of Emperor Rudolf II, exhibition catalog, Národní galerie v Praze /
  National Gallery in Prague, Praha 2010, pp. 269-277. The original painting or the
  original design fits not well in the production of Savery before 1609. In his (probably)
  second print-series with bohemian wood landscapes from around 1610 he arrives to
  very expressive figures of trees. The composition of the Forest landscape (Cologne)
  derives from this achievements. There is very probably also some influence of Jan
  Brueghel in this design, but the painting is in my opinion surely not by him.</p>"
