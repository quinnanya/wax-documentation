comment: "<p>I had my doubts about this one and it is not included in Ertz 2008-10,
  not even mentioned under the copy he accepts as his #124 there. Sutton 1992 lists
  a number of further versions of this; one that is pretty much identical to the present
  work and to Ertz 124 (but is not identical to either) and is also signed & dated
  1607 (copper, 20.5 x 30.5), Graf Wachtmeister, Wanas). Another that is more a variant,
  with a wagon on the road at the left, is signed and dated 1610 (copper, 21.5 x 26.7),
  Chatsworth, Duke of Devonshire collection. Sutton does not accept either of these.<br
  />The Devonshire version in turn exists in many versions:<br />1. Brussels (Galerie
  Girous, March 15 1926, #10 (panel, 27 x 37).<br />2. With Slatter, London, April
  1953 (copper, 12.6 x 19.4)<br />3. Formerly with Galerie R. Flinck, Brussels (copper,
  24 x 32.5)<br />4. with Alexander Gallery, London, December 1978 (copper, 21.5 x
  31.7)<br />5. one sold Sotheby's, London, March 24 1976 #93, possibly the same as
  the above.</p><p>Other versions and copies of the present painting noted by Sutton:<br
  />1. sold Paris, Galliera, June 20 1961 (copper, 21 x 22)<br />2. sold Paris, Charpentier,
  May 12 1948, (panel, 20 x 30.5)<br />3. sold London, Christie's, April 14 1978 #123
  (panel, 19.7 x 31.1) -- possibly same as above<br />4. sold Brussels, Palais des
  Beaux-Arts, May 7 1975 (copper, 17.5 x 22.5)</p>"
