comment: <p>This painting was sent to Borromeo in 1607 but was then returned with
  a request that they put a landscape behind the figure of the madonna.  In his "Musaeum"
  Borromeo mentions other garlands painted by Brueghel in his possession, but this
  is the only one that can be exactly identified.</p>
