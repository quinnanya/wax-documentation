comment: "<p>One of many copies of this composition, most obviously including a version
  in Munich, Ertz #260. There is a drawing by Rottenhammer related to this composition
  in Prague, which seems much related to his experiences in Venice, especially the
  work of Tintoretto. Drawing illustrated in Borggrefe et al, p. 174. The Brake/Prague
  exhibition catalogue llisted ten copies, of varying dimensions, by Rottenhammer's
  studio and later followers; pp. 124-6. </p><p>Another version of this work was sold
  by Christie's Paris on 23 June 2010: oil on panel, 33 x 48.</p>"
