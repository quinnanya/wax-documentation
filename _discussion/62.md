comment: "<p>Ertz had originally attributed this as a collaboration between Jan the
  Elder and Jan the Younger. </p><p>The monkeys are, in some cases, directly based
  on those in the oil sketches, #s 583 & 584a. THere are numerous further versions
  of this picture; one may soon be hanging in the Rubenshuis. </p><p>According to
  Sotheby's a good copy of this work, also on copper and probably by Jan Brueghel
  the Younger, was sold by them on December 12, 1984, lot 177.</p>"
