comment: "<p>The dating of 1597 is suggested by Pijl. This would make it an early
  work executed in Antwerp for shipment back to Milan. It is certainly very much connected
  to Landscape executed in Milan two years earlier Ambrosiana 75/27).<br />According
  to Pijl there is a version on canvas, larger (73 x 98) which is attributed to Milanese
  painter Antonio Procaccini.  He doesn't say if that attribution is right or not.
  \ Does this imply that Procaccini (1571-1630) was asked at some point to copy the
  picture, or did it as an exercise? </p><p>The figure is based on Paphnutius in image
  #12 of Sadelers' Solitudo series, but the landscape is based on #23 in their Sylvae
  sacrae series of 1594.</p>"
