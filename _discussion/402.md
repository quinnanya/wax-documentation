comment: "<p>A very interesting piece because clearly a peasant genre scene done before
  serious engagement with his father's works. The dancers here, their clothing and
  even their manner of dancing, is completely unconnected to that of Pieter the Elder;
  whereas a year or two after this he will start working through Pieter's studio material
  and thereafter all his peasant festivity works will be marked by that knowledge.
  This all fits with the early date Ertz assigns the work, although the horse/mule
  at the left seems rather better than most of Jan's horses at this early date.</p>"
