comment: "<p>Poor related copy sold at R. H. Ward, London, on May 15, 1934 with a
  pendant of a village scene and windmill. Both of these works are attributed as Jan
  Brueghel II and both are works on copper with a dimension of 15 x 20.5 cm.<br />Poor
  variant formerly art market Monaco (Sotheby's 15/16.vi.90 #506), (panel, 17 x 20).
  \  Another work related to that variant sold Stockholm, Anktrousverk, 22/23.v.01
  #1401, (panel, 17 x 22).  Different variant formerly art market London: Koetser
  1964 (copper, 12.1 x 17.8).<br />Variant in Dresden, dated same year, has fascinating
  relationship to this one:  it's as if he's walked to a different place and looked
  at the same pair of windmills from the front instead of from the back.  Query does
  this argue that there were real structures that he observed or that--as with Rembrandt
  and figural compositions--he was able to sort of spin things around in his imagination?
  \ The Dresden painting is also on different support and much larger.</p>"
