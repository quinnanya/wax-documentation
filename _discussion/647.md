comment: "<p>The Honig Database has rejected the attribution of this painting to Jan
  Brueghel the Elder. Figures are very poor.<br />There is the mark of Pieter Stas
  with his initials on the back of the copper panel.<br />There was once a signature
  and date (recorded on RKD photo which came from Lunde) that is no longer visible
  in the Johnny van Haeften photo reproduction. This work was displayed at TEFAF in
  Maastricht, 2008.<br />poor, much altered version (borrowing motifs from different
  paintings) in Luik, Mus. Curtius et d'Ansembourg, inv. Mx/2468 (panel, 30.5 x 41.5)</p>"
