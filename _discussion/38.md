comment: "<p>Very good copy on panel formerly Cassirer Amsterdam, 1936. Photo in Witt
  Library.</p><p>Very loose copy of whole series cleverly sold by Sotheby's at same
  sale as variants (London, 8.vii.99 #54, all on copper laid on panel, 42.5 x 58)--attributed
  there to Jan the Elder's studio although neither landscape nor figures look very
  good. Another set of copies on canvas, 54.5 x 85.5, with Finck (Brussels), 30.xi.63
  #s 46-49, clearly not very good. Yet another set on copper, 53 x 80, somewhere French
  (RKD page with no annotation). Set of copies by Jan the Younger on canvas, 50 x
  73, sold Brussels (Finck) Nov24-Dec17, 1967.  These are monogrammed and dated 1642.
  Very interesting copy of Earth with a Fire that's a variant of Getty painting formerly
  collection Etienne Delarmay. Copy of this version of Earth with Alberts van Smizzen
  (??), Amsterdam, 1990. Copies of various distance from original (probably none directly
  from the studio of Jan the Elder):</p><ul><li>Helbing sale, Zunfthaus, Zurich February
