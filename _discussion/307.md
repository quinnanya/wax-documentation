comment: "<p>This painting is a copy of Ertz #249 which was done with the collaboration
  of Hans Rottenhammer in Venice. While this would theoretically be possible is would
  be incredibly unusual. The Rottenhammer collaboration is from 1607-8; Ertz thinks
  that this one is from 1615 which seems very unlikely to me.</p>"
