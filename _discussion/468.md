comment: "<p>Proportions of this painting, nearly square, are very odd for Jan and
  do not match those of variants below at all: could it have been cut down?<br />Good
  copy  in Sarasota, Ringling Museum, inv. 765 (panel, 54.6 x 76.2).  The Ringling
  Museum's catalogue entry, by Franklin Robinson (cat. #6) notes that that this version
  is very heavily restored and one cannot tell if it was original or not.  However,
  underdrawing and pentimenti are visible through thin paint layer, arguing that it
  might actually be original.  Ertz now attributes it to Jan the Younger, his 1984
  cat. #44.<br />Another version identical to Sarasota work with similarly panoramic
  proportions but smaller in size (copper 27 x 35.1) formerly art market Amsterdam
  (de Boer 1954), bad repro. at RKD voordening folder 31.   I think that Robinson
  is mixed up here in listing the Sarasota one as with De Boer in 1954; this is a
  different painting. Evidently another work on copper, 27 x 35.1, formerly in Frans
  collection, Brussels -- could this be the De Boer version?</p>"
