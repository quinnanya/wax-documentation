comment: '<p>The attribution of this painting has been questioned, and it was not
  included in Ertz 1979. The alternate attribution, of both this painting and its
  copy (formerly Amsterdam, De Boer; copper, 8 x 11.5), has ben to Joris Hoefnagel.
  While the Ambrosiana painting is clearly related to Hoefnagel’s work, it is certainly
  by Jan Brueghel, and is explicitly listed as such in Borromeo’s own 1618 “Act of
  Donation”: “Un scorcio et una Rosa in un piccolo quadretto di man del detto Giovanni
  Brueghel.” The full document is published by Arlene Quint, Cardinal Federico Borromeo
  as a Patron and Critic of the Arts and his MUSAEUM of 1625 (New York: Garland, 1986),
  293-306. A less settled question is whether the 1605 rametto refers to this picture,
  for it has been argued that this is the bagatello that Brueghel sent his patron
  in 1596, shortly after his return to Antwerp (letter of October 10, 1596; Crivelli
  7).  I feel that the present painting must have been sent in 1605, for it relates
  not at all to the works Brueghel had been doing up to then, while it relates rather
  well to pictures he began sending to Borromeo shortly thereafter.</p><p>In 1611
  codicil there is also mention of a <em>Hazelnut and Flowers</em> by Jan, described
  as a "very little painting", now lost.</p><p>Another copy in Academia Carrara, Bergamo.</p>'
