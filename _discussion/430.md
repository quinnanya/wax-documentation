comment: "<p>A early collaboration with very little input by Jan Brueghel. Dr. Honig
  also believes it's possible that the painting is not genuine, however it is worth
  considering that Jan did paint small portions of the piece or that members of his
  studio did.<br />There is the mark of Pieter Stas and the city of Antwerp on the
  back of the copper panel.</p>"
