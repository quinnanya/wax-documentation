comment: "<p>The figures in this painting are really not very good.<br />Ertz accepts
  half a dozen variants of this composition (as of 1979) and there are other more
  clearly inferior copies/variants in the Museum Mayer-Van den Bergh, the Rijksmuseum,
  and a distant and more panoramic variant in the DVRK, The Hague. Clearly this was
  a popular composition often replicated.</p>"
