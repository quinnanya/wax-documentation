comment: '<p>Described in Leopold Wilhelm inventory 1659 as follows: Ein porcelanes
  Blumenkrügel von Öhlfarb auff Holcz, warin Tulipanen, weisze unndt Roszen, wie auch
  andere Blumen... 2 Span 6 Finger hoch unndt 2 Span 1 Finger braidt. Original von
  dem jungen Brögel.<br /> An autograph copy of this painting exists in the Netherlands
  (please see <a href="/janbrueghel/flowers-in-earthenware-vase-netherlands">Flowers
  in Earthenware Vase (Netherlands)</a>). These two flower pictures would be Jan''s
  first works in this genre, predating the Ambrosiana picture that he sold to Borromeo
  in the summer of 1606. Note that both of these 1605 pictures are executed on panel
  and were thus probably for local patrons -- flower bouquets were already an established
  genre in Antwerp at this time. The painting for Borromeo, however, was done on copper,
  as was usual for Jan''s works destined for export.<br />Another a weak copy of the
  present composition is in Art Institute of Chicago (panel, 65.5 x 46.5).  Another
  copy is in Florence, Villa Poggio Imperiale, inv. #165 (panel, 63 x 45); this is
  Ertz''s Jan Brueghel the Younger #274.<br />A copy in Florence, Villa Poggio Imperiale,
  inv. #165 (63 x 45 cm)</p>'
