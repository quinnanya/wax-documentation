comment: '<p>Diaz Padron suggests that the interior icon was also painted by Jan;
  while this is surely not true, Van Balen does seem to have tried to conform his
  style to Jan''s here. DP also notes that some groupings of flowers here are replicated
  from other garland paintings, such as those in the Louvre, Munich, Schleissheim,
  and the Prado''s other garland painting. Here, many items of produce are added into
  the garland to give a general sense of abundance.</p><p>Diaz Padron also suggests
  that several documents refer to this painting, and give it a provenance back to
  Isabella in Brussels who would then have sent it to the Infanta in Spain. He notes
  that in a letter to Bianchi of April 22, 1611, Jan Brueghel mentions making two
  versions of a garland painting, one of them for Borromeo and the other for Isabella.
  However, this seems too early for it to refer to the present painting. On the other
  hand we do have the following description from the 1623 Spanish Inventory:  "#I
  939  Otra tabla de Nuestra Señora con el Niño en los brazos con un festón de frutas
  y flores con moldura de ébano que envió  la señora ynfanta de Flandes.”</p>'
