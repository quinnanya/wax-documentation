comment: '<p>British Museum website: "The attribution to Jan Brueghel is not certain:
  when compared to drawings of a similar subject (at the Nationalmuseum Stockholm,
  the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin and the Albertina Vienna), the London sheet seems
  weak. Although Brueghel painted many robberies, this drawing cannot be connected
  to any of the known paintings; see K. Ertz, "Jan Brueghel der Ältere: Die Gemälde",
  Cologne, 1979, pp.149-156."</p>'
