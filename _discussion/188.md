comment: "<p>Related: a version of Munich Paradise with Scenes from Genesis and Four
  Elements by De Clerck and Alsloot was sold Sotheby's London 5.xii.2007 #16; it's
  a large copper and is signed and dated 1613.  Catalog points out that other versions
  are usually dated around 1607-12 but this new work argues for a later dating.  This
  painting is signed by both artists, which is interesting; it also has an old collection
  number on it, 1148, suggesting it was once part of a big collection, probably (say
  Sotheby's) in Spain.<br />The mythical horned ass at the left originally had no
  horns and was in profile; this was changed at some later stage of painting. Version
  in French private collection shows how it originally looked; see Munich 2013 p.
  154.</p>"
