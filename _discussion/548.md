comment: "<p>This is ostensibly a variant of a questioned work in the Prado dated
  1603.  Ertz also considers as autograph variants his 1979 #s 117 and 272.  The latter
  is however a very different composition. </p><p>In Ertz's book on Jan the Younger
  he lists many further variants on this:  </p><ul><li>EJBII #18:  Prado (panel, 46
  x 75, inv. #1427) which looks like a terrible painting in poor condition and is
  actually a variant with very different staffage. ERtz dates late 1620s </li><li>Ertz
  JBII #19:  identical copy formerly art market, Paris (Galerie Aaron 1983, panel,
  43.5 x 73.5) which he dates late 1620s</li><li>Ertz JBII #20:  a quite altered and
  much more heavy-handed variant in private collection (panel, 24 x 32.5, sig. & d.
  Brueghel 1612) which Ertz dates to 1630s</li><li>Ertz JBII #21:  identical copy
  Bourg-en-Bresse, Musee de l'Ain (panel, 46 x 75) dated to 1630s.</li></ul>"
