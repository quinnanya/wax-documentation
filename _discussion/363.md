  target="_blank">"Garland with the Virgin, the Christ Child and Two Angels" on the
  Prado Website</a><br />The identification of Giulio Cesare Procaccini as the collaborator
  is doubtful but is generally retained because nobody has come up with a better idea.
  Early inventories do not name the collaborator. Jan would presumably have sent a
  garland to Milan for this guy he didn''t even know to fill in. Of course that is
  not impossible, and Procaccini was connected to the Borromeo circuit. Mozzarelli
  1999 attributes the central figure group to G. C. Procaccini and dates the piece
  to c. 1618-20. </p><p>There is an inferior copy in Bologna and there is a copy attributed
  to Jan the Younger.</p><p>(Museum notes):  The relationship (painterly) between
  interior and exterior here is very unusual.  Whoever painted interior has same aesthetic
  as Jan Brueghel:  the super-refined painterliness that refuses to erase itself but
  at same time demands incredibly close visual attention. So the two levels of the
  painting almost compete with one another visually rather than separating out--flowers
  here do not "adorn" what is within them because it isn''t clear how "within" them
  it is.</p>'
