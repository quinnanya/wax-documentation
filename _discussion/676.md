comment: <p>Copy in Elmira, Arnot Art Museum, on copper, 25 x 34, which Ertz mysteriously
  attributes to Jan and an unknown Flemish painter from around 1605. In the copy,
  the child who strangely accompanyies the leftmost nymph in the present work is not
  there. Ertz dates the present work and the Elmira version bizarrely early, like
  before Jan went to Italy, which is plainly impossible.  Clearly De Backer cannot
  have collaborated with Brueghel while the latter was in Italy, though; there is
  no record that De Backer ever was there.  It's unlikely, but not as far as I know
  impossible, that they could have collaborated after Jan came back to Antwerp. De
  Backer seems to have died in France around 1600, so was he already there when Jan
  returned? At the RKD the present work is filed under Hendrik de Clerck, which would
  solve the dating problem. It doesn't seem good enough to be him, and yet I feel
  that it's closer to him than to any other figure painter. The quality of this work
  is mixed, with very nice parts and very bad ones.  The nymphs in the background
  are awkward, poorly drawn, and don't connect spatially to the ones in the foreground
  (who are very nicely done).  It's hard to say about the attribution of the foreground
  and landscape but it doesn't scream "early work" to me.  In fact the dog reminds
  me of things that come a little later in Jan's career.  The two dead rabbits at
  the lower left are poorly done and make me doubt the whole thing. I would reject
  both this and the copy.  There is something really wrong with the space, as there
  never is in a real Brueghel.  There needed to be a greater distance constructed
  between the foreground and background figures and the landscape painter failed to
  do this.  And there is no way that the first paintings of Jan have this kind of
  stagey foreground with dead game and hunting dogs; it's just wrong. Possibly more
  research into the process by which the painting was made could help us to understand
  these discrepancies.</p>
