comment: '<p>K. Ertz (2008-10) speculates that this Paris painting of "Allegory of
  Earth" is part of a series of the elements which Jan Brueghel painted between 16010-1611.

  was with the present work at Berlin, Gallery van Diemen, in 1935; I don''t know
  if that is the same work as the above London painting that Ertz now suggests as
  part of the series. </p><p>Variant sold at Christie''s, New York, January 11, 1991,
