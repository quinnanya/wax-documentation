comment: "<p>This is the missing link between the Bril painting in Borromeo's collection
  and all the forest landscapes with hunters now attributed to Bruegel. Who this large
  group of works are actually by is still very unclear as far as I am concerned. Borromeo
  thought his work was by Bril. But the present work suggests that is was by whomever
  painted all the forest landscapes with hunters.</p>"
