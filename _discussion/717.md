comment: "<p>Several related drawings, including one in Amsterdam, Rijksprentenkabinet
  (inv. #1919:34), a drawing which Winner dates just before 1600 and he sees some
  connections with motifs from Coninxloo.<br />Lots of doubts noted in files at RKD
  on this one and I agree.  There's some wierd streaking of surface that isn't like
  Jan, and figures don't have his usual verge.<br />When this was sold at Christie's
  in 1976 the catalog listed it as being on copper: which is it?<br />Copy Goteborg,
  Konstmuseet; parts of background borrowed by a follower in Forest Landscape in Leipzig,
  Museum der Bildenden Kunste; copy of same size but on panel (note this trend!) sold
  London (Christie's 5.ii.88 #132).  The last of these is now accepted as Ertz 2008-10,
  #233.</p>"
