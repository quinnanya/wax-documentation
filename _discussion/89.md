comment: <p>Exhibited in Brake/Prague (Borggrefe 2008) as being just by Rottenhammer.
  There are, the catalog states, many copies of this composition, including one that
  has been attributed to Jan Brueghel; for the other copies see Borggrefe p.126. </p><p>The
  date on this work has been disputed. Pelzer dated it after 1606, Mai put it in 1598
  and Schlichtenmaier even earlier, in Rottenhammer's Venetian period. Munich catalogue
  now suggests ca. 1597.</p><p>The motif of God surrounded by putti is repeated (how
  closely?) in the <a href="/janbrueghel/winter-landscape-with-angels-strewing-flowers">Winter
  Landscape with Angels Strewing Flowers</a> that Rottenhammer and Brueghel executed
  in collaboration.</p>
