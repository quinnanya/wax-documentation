  attributed to Jan Brueghel (I?) and Jan van Kessel (panel, 69 x 115 cm) sold at
  auction in Antwerp, Mar. 13, 1932, #67.<br />A copy attributed to JBI and van Balen
  described as "Allegory of Abundance" sold by de Hirsch, June 17, 1904, #11.<br />Copy
  attributed to Jan Brueghel (I?) and Jan van Kessel sold Brussels, Dec. 8, 1924 by
  P. Verrier.<br />Copy attribued to to Jan Brueghel and H. van Balen (panel, 66 x
  108 cm), sold Vienna, J. C. von Klinkosch, April 2, 1889, #29.<br />Possibly same
  copy in Goldschmidt collection in 1898 (see Sight) and I think was sold 17 June
  1904  from collection Barone de Il (?) along with Sight.  Panel, 68 x 110, close
  to original size and not bad.<br />A hideously poor copy sold Fievez 8-9 December
  1924 #26  (panel, 170 x 112 which cannot be right). Could this be identical with
  first one listed above?</p><p>Represented at left is a version of Ertz 488 or 489,
  the Fruit Garland with Offering to Ceres that is a collaboration between Jan and
  Van Balen.</p>'
