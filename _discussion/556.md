comment: '<p>The Golden Age after Abraham Bloemaert</p><p>The painting depicts the
  Golden Age under the rule of Saturn at the beginning of mankind, according Ovid,
  Met. I, 89-112. In my opinion, it belongs not to the genre of allegory, but to mythology.</p><p>The
  picture is a copy after a print by Nicolaes de Bruyn (Hollstein IV, no. 129-1(3)),
  dated 1604, after a design of Abraham Bloemaert. The signed and 1603 dated drawing
  is in Frankfurt (Städel Museum, Graphische Sammlung, inv. no. 2878). The painting
  has the same direction as the print, the drawing is reverse to it. The print provides
  a terminus post quem for the picture of 1604.<br />Reference to the print, by example
  in Amsterdam, Rijksprentenkabinet, inv. no. RP-P-OB-16.119: URL:<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.338594">http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.338594</a>
  </p><p>The composition is perhaps the most influential by Abraham Bloemaert, with
  several engraved and many painted copies, see: Jaap Bolten, Notes on Abraham Bloemaert’s
  Drawings of the Golden Age, in: De arte et libris, Festschrift Erasmus 1934-84,
  ed. by Abraham Horodisch, Amsterdam 1984, pp. 23-41.</p><p>It seems me quite implausible,
  that Rubens painted the figure in this copy. In my opinion nothing hints to his
  personal style, visible in his copies after other masters. With all reservation,
  because I do not know the original, the figures could perhaps painted by Hendrick
  van Balen, regarding the incarnate.</p>'
