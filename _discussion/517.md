comment: "<p>Summary catalogue of collection says that this painting is on canvas
  although it has been noted elsewhere as on panel, which seems more likely. We have
  followed collection catalogue on front page.</p><p>This painting is a copy of Ertz
  #67, possibly begun at the same time as that one but completed five years later.</p>"
