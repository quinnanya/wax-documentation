comment: <p>Ertz argues strongly that this is a second-rate work ("mittelmassigen
  Qualitat"), the product of Jan the Younger and Rubens's studio. Nobody else has
  agreed with him on this. If he were right, the painting would be much later than
  all other scholars date it, by at least a decade. According to Mulders, the painting
  was done for Albrecht and Isabella, and the composition was initiated by Rubens
  with Brueghel doing his parts afterwards.</p><p>Theme is from Ovid, Metamorphoses,
  VIII.   Ch. V, 545-76 and IX, 89-92.<br />Copy sold at Fischer Gallery, Lucerne,
  August 26-September 3, 1938 (canvas, 121 x 164 cm).</p>
