comment: "<p>Stiff copy (signed) in National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, photo
  RKD (copper, 35 x 55) -- page on wiki; slightly better copy formerly private collection,
  Warsaw (Graaf Prezdziecki) (copper, 46 x 60). </p><p>This work has been connected
  to a composition by Durer; although it would be 6 years before Jan would copy Durer's
  great Crucifixion drawing in Prague, the composition was evidently known in the
  Netherlands and had been used as a model for other works.</p>"
