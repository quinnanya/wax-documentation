comment: '<p>Copies: one sold Galliera (Paris December 7, 1971) panel, 54 x 41; another
  by follower or studio w/ Gal. Pallamar, Vienna, 1968.  Also one by Jan the Younger,
  with a few variations in table/ground area, in Pasadena, Norton Simon Museum. Preparatory
  drawing for this in British Museum (pen & ink, 25.5 x 35.6, signed).<br />Although
  Ertz has gone on/off about attribution here, others (Segal, Hairs, Brenninkmeijer-de
  Rooij) have OK''d it. Brenninkmeijer-de Rooij suggests a date of 1611-18. Ertz gives
  it a later date so that he can argue for Jan the Younger as assistant, but that
  is really not necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The
  original size of this painting is 46.5 x 33 cm (octagonal); it has since been altered
  to 52.5 x 43 cm.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.nortonsimonfoundation.org/collections/browse_artist.php?name=Brueghel%2C+Jan%2C+the+Younger">variation</a>
