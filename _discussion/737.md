comment: "<p>Variant Milan, Brera, Ertz #153--in bad condition.<br />Another copy
  in Aschaffenburg; Ertz calls this one Jan the Younger.<br />Very weak copy sold
  Sotheby's London 16.ii.72 #103.<br />An even worse version in Sheffield, Graves
  Art Gallery<br />Another almost phenomenally bad--but interesting--variant with
  a market stall in foreground in Utrecht, Centraal Museum, 1952 cat. #1047 (copper,
  19.4 x 27.1).<br />Another bizarrely bad one w/ Gal. Stein, Paris, before 1946 (copper,
  23 x 34).<br />A similarly weak variant sold Rotterdam (Notarishuis 29.x.69 #9)
  copper, 11 x 19<br />A much later poor variant sold London (Christies 18.v.90 #102),
  39.5 x 53.5<br />fairly close copy sold New York (Christie's 15.i.86 #157), copper,
  22.9 x 34<br />There are even more in the voorordening at the RKD.  Some of these
  are pastiches using bits from different paintings (like 197 too).  Some are really,really
  bad.</p><p>A suggested conclusion from the oddly large number of very low-quality
  variants: could the original have been purchased by a dealer for replication by
  paid hacks outside of Jan's studio?</p>"
