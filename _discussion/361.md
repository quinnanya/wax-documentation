comment: <p>As with so many of their early paintings done with Rottenhammer, Munich
  catalogue now wants to date this to Jan's Antwerp years. Obviously Jan did some
  long-distance collaboration with HR but I don't see why they "all" need to be moved
  to 1597; only for the Jerome is there a really solid reason.</p>
