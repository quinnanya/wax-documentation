comment: "<p>A fascinating copy/variant of this work was painted by Frans Francken:
  Harting 1989, p.50 & #275a. It was exhibited Munich 2013, cat. # 39: copper, 27
  x 40.8; Munich, Bayer. Staatsgem.sam., inv. #1879. This would be a very early work
  by Francken, before he was even a master in the guild, and suggests his strong early
  connections to Brueghel's studio.</p>"
