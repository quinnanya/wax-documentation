comment: "<p>Variant on this theme formerly on the art market, The Hague (Nystad,
  1978), also on copper, 25.6 x 35. See Honig database q00004.</p><p>The figural elements
  of this painting derive from a print by Philip Galle after Hans Bol showing fishing
  for a sperm whale dated 1582.  The whale, the nude man in the boat, and the people
  in the neighboring boat are all reshuffled from this print.  Print is part of large
  series of fishing scenes, Hollstein 568ff.  The print is  reproduced in Bremerhaven
  1991, vol.2, pp.88-89, cat. #11.</p>"
