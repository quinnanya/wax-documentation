comment: '<p>Letter to Borromeo of March 6, 1609: Jan has bought a painting by Steenwyck
  "io farra in ditto quadret alcun figurini."</p><p>In a letter to Borromeo of 27
  April 1609 Jan writes that he''s about to send Borromeo a "quadro de perspettiuo"
  by Steenwijck in which "gli figurini ho fatto al modo mio:  mia moglie et doi figlioli
  ho fatto al natural" (Crivelli p.147)  We assume that means woman in foreground,
  his wife Caterina who he married in 1605.  The children would be Jan the Younger
  and Passchasia.<br />Pijl also says that original figures were repainted by Jan--you
  can still see some that he painted out.(yes, where dogs are now there was a woman)<br
  />Ertz and others have called this "Antwerp Cathedral" but Pijl says you can''t
  say that, you can''t identify architecture or decoration.<br />1586 is year that
  Steenwijk moved to Frankfurt so this could have been painted there or in Antwerp.The
  original painting was done by Hendrick van Steenwyck the Elder in 1586; it is dated
  at the lower center. Brueghel painted in the figures and sold it to Borromeo in
  1609.<br />I have seen this painting. It is not in great condition and has been
  somewhat abraded. Figures in the foregound have been painted out or overpainted;
  Howarth speculated that these might have been figures by Steenwyck. You can also
  see a lot of Steenwyck''s underdrawing, a very complete perspective system with
  possibly a pin indentation?</p>'
