comment: "<p>This whole cluster of Forest Landscapes have only been attributed to
  Jan rather recently, largely based on the arguments of Pijl. Previously they were
  usually associated with Coninxloo, understandably -- if they are by Jan, they certainly
  link him and Coninxloo.</p><p>In this work, the paint appears to be rather heavy
  and pasty, unlike Jan's more characteristic works of a couple of years later. But
  it is hard to know what he would have been painting like in 1593! The face of the
  hunter is quite characteristic of Jan.</p>"
