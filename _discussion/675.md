comment: '<p>I am doubtful about the attribution of this work.<br />This work was
  displayed at TEFAF in Maastricht in 2005.<br />Material from the catalogue of the
  Sotheby''s sale: "This is one of a group of paintings by Jan Brueghel I dating from
  the first decade of the seventeenth century depicting travellers paths meandering
  through woodlands. One of the earliest is the Road in a wood of 1605 in the Alte
  Pinakothek, Munich.... also one of the same subject and dated 1607 in the Metropolitan
  Museum of Art, New York, with five autograph versions and variants: one in a Belgian
  private collection; that in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp (with
  staffage by Vrancx); two other paintings in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich (one also
  with staffage by Vrancx); and a painting in the Saulmann collection, Florence. Since
  Ertz''s 1979 publication, two other paintings have come to light depicting paths
  through woods: the present picture and that exhibited in the 1993-4 Age of Rubens
  exhibition (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts; and Toledo, Museum of Art, no. 82), also
  dated 1608.</p><p>That latter work and the present painting are of particular interest,
  representing as they do the only examples of Jan''s paintings of this group - with
  the 1605 Munich picture - that do not closely derive from that in the Metropolitan
  Museum. The Boston exhibition picture maintains the secondary vista of the Munich
  painting, whereas the present work follows the advance of the Metropolitan painting
  in restricting the perspective to a single vanishing point; the staffage, on the
  other hand, in some ways recalls more the Munich landscape, notably the foreground
  wagon with, riding in it, a mother and child, whilst the broken trees and horse''s
  skeleton show the development of the Metropolitan Museum painting....</p><p>This
  picture was formerly in the remarkable collection of Etienne-François, duc de Choiseul.
  Two extraordinary visual records make it possible to reconstruct the taste of Choiseul''s
  collection: the ''Choiseul box'' (1770-1; Paris, Baron Elie de Rothschild private
  collection), a gold snuff-box made by Louis Roucel with miniature views by Louis-Nicolas
  van Blarenberghe, depicting Choiseul and his friends at his Paris hôtel in the rue
  de Richelieu, surrounded by his collection; and the 1771 catalogue of the collection
  by Pierre-François Basan, consisting of 124 engravings of Choiseul''s finest pictures
  and one of the earliest catalogues of a private collection to be copiously illustrated.</p>'
