comment: '<p>The Lyon "Allegory of Fire (Venus in the Forge of Vulcan)" is part of
  a series of the elements which Jan Brueghel painted between 1606-1611. See Also:</p><ul><li><a

  Jan Antoon van der Baren inventory of Leopold Wilhelm''s collection, 1659, f.235r:
  "435,36,37 unndt 438.  Vier Landschäfftel von Öhlfarb auf Holcz, warin die vier
  Elementen mit underschiedlichen schönen Sachen.  Die Ramen schartz unndt die innere
  Leistel verguldt, jedes 2 Spann 6 Finger hoch und 4 Span 4 Finger braidt.  Original
  von vom Brügel."   Cited Lyons 1991, p.30 n.1, quoting Berger 1883, p.CXXXVII.  The
  measurements equal about 54.1 x 91.5, so I suppose they measured the frames along
  with the painting: this makes sense as measurements are c.8 cm larger each direction
  rather than proportionally different.    </p><p>These four works were appropriated
  by the French in 1809.</p><p>The date on this painting has been retraced; only the
  date on the Fire in this series is absolutely secure and according to the museum
  catalog it reads 1606 although Ertz still dates it as ca. 1611.</p><p>There is some
  debate as to whether this or the Doria-Pamphilj Four Elements series is the prime
  version. Buijs in the Lyons catalogue says neither is the original; Werche says
  that this is the prime version. The Lyons paintings have recently been restored.
  There are many pentimenti, especially in the parts by Van Balen.</p>'
