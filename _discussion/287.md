comment: "<p>Neumeister now says that garland was almost finished when figures were
  added; but also that the original plan (revealed in x-ray) was for a figural composition
  close to that of the Jan/Van Balen collaboration, Ertz 2008-10 #484. She suggests
  that reworking was done at request of a buyer, though did that person also suggest
  a new (and unique) collaborator??</p>"
