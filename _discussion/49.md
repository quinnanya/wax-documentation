comment: '<p>The Milan "Allegory of Fire" is part of a series of the elements which
  Jan Brueghel painted between 1608-1621. See Also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/earth-paradise-landscape-paris-louvre">Earth:
  Paradise Landscape (Paris, Louvre)</a> </li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-air-paris">Allegory
  of Air (Paris)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-water-milan">Allegory
  of Water (Milan)</a></li></ul><p>This work was sent to Borromeo in December 1608.
  Yet it is not mentioned in Borromeo''s 1611 codicil so possibly it had been sent
  back to Antwerp for further adjustment.</p><p>Note that there is a scene of the
  Temptation of St. Anthony in the background of this version. Interesting that at
  the same time he sent this to Borromeo, Jan sent him a separate picture with that
  very subject. Jones (Borromeo 233-234) says that there was another St. Anthony that
  was sent to Borromeo in 1609 but was a pastiche or knock-off work by studio retouched
  by JB and Borromeo didn''t keep it.  She says it was rediscovered in a private collection
  in Milan in 1956.<br />Tivoli temple in background here.</p>'
