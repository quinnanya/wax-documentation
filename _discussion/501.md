comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Formerly described as anonymous by Popham, this
  drawing was subsequently attributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Schoubroeck
  (by Martin Royalton-Kisch) before being given its present attribution to Jan Breughel
  the Elder again.<br />Very similar drawings, showing Roman ruins (possibly showing
  the Colosseum) and executed in the same loose style and with the same application
  of the wash, are signed and inscribed by Jan Brueghel. Two sheets in the Museum
  Boijmans-Van Beuningen (inv.nos.3-4) are authentically inscribed "Roma" and "1593"
  or "1595". A third drawing in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin (inv.no.26327, bought
  at Sotheby''s, 26 November 1970) is signed "Brueghel". A drawing by Schoubroeck,
  signed and dated 1595, in the Fondation Custodia in Paris shows some similarities
  with these works by Bruegel; see K.G. Boon, ''L''Ã©poque de Lucas de Leyde et Pierre
  Bruegel'', exh.cat. Florence-Paris, 1980-1981, cat.no.125 and K.G. Boon, ''The Netherlandish
  and German Drawings of the XVth and XVIth centuries of the Frits Lugt Collection,
  Paris, 1992, cat.no.181. Schoubroeck''s paintings, however, feature italianised
  ruined buildings, rather than existing Roman ruins."</p>'
