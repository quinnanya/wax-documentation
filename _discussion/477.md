comment: "<p>A related painting is in Munich, inv. #830, signed and dated 1608: same
  landscape, different figures. On panel but very similar in size. Might have been
  done in studio concurrently with this one, or left unfinished and completed later
  by Jan the Younger. Ertz attributes it to Jan the Younger.  Another pretty close
  variant was sold at Dorotheum, Vienna, December 1 1970 (panel, 29 x 43) -- again
  similar in size but on panel.</p>"
