comment: "<p>Ertz believes this to be a work by Jan the Younger done shortly after
  he took over his father's studio in the late 1620s. It would be quite possible that
  the painting, a variant of an earlier work by his father (Ertz 1979 #114), was left
  incomplete in the studio like many other works and finished by Jan the younger;
  the closeness in size between the two argues for a connection in manufacture rather
  than a later pastiche using drawings, I would think. The present work could also
  have been executed in the studio at the same time as the other, though. </p><p>According
  to the Munich catalogue the signature on this is not autograph and the piece is
  probably a studio work. This seems plausible to me. They do not agree with Ertz's
  suggested attribution to Jan the Younger; see Munich 2013, p. 268</p>"
