comment: "<p>Could be a studio piece, but not done by Jan himself.  It must have been
  done by someone with access to the drawings used in the Hague Paradise Landscape
  (& others), but there are numeral moments were the coherence of the animals break
  down and the brushstrokes are not used the way Jan uses then to give life and motion
  to a work.  However, this was also probably not done by Jan Brueghel the Younger,
  who painted entirely different paradise landscapes.</p>"
