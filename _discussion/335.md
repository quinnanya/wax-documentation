comment: <p>There are a lot of strange things about this painting, not the least of
  which is Ertz's super-early (pre-Italy) dating to make the collaboration with Jacob
  de Backer work. I am listing it as "inside" Jan's studio but it doesn't relate well
  to anything else and I can't believe the collaborator is correct either.</p>
