comment: "<p>Copies: one formerly Richard Green, London (panel, 55.8 x 96.5), another
  Marseille, Mus. des Beaux-Arts.  Those are the two copies listed by Ertz and the
  Green one might duplicate one of those below: copy by Jan the Younger (according
  to Ertz) sold London (Christie's April 7, 1995 lot #11). A seriously feeble copy
  of this Air with other elements that don't exactly match rest of this set sold London
  (Sothebys 8.vii.99 #54, o/copper 42.5 x 58). There are photographs of numerous other
  copies at RKD:  Askol Trust (??); one sold London (Christie's June 23 1967 # 8)
  (panel, 56 x 96), one in bad shape sold London (Sotheby's April 4, 1984 lot #47)
  (panel, 56 x 96.5), awful copy attributed to Jan the Younger & van Balen sold London
  (Christie's May 23, 1986 #97 (panel, 55.3 x 89.5)). Copy sold London (Sotheby's
  April 18, 2002 #16 (panel, 54.5 x 94)) as Jan the Younger and Van Balen (seems pretty
  decent though damaged). This Doria Pamphili picture and the Lyons version are close
  to identical, although the Lyons one has some brightly-colored birds that are not
  in this one.  Why would that be?  And oddly, the Birds of Paradise here seem to
  have no legs. Surely he knew better by this time, or perhaps not in fact. Preparatory
  drawing in Braunschweig, Herzog Anton-Ulrich Museum, Inv. # K.K.79  (see Winner
  1972).  This is related to all of the Air compositions yet is exactly followed in
  none of them.   There is also a sketch in Dresden, Kupferstich-Kabinett, that Winner
  does not accept (1961 p.231).  Moreover there is a sheet in the van Regteren Altena
  collection in Amsterdam that seems related to an unrealized  telescope there is
  here just grabbing a bird.</p>"
