comment: "<p>The most likely candidate for the Scipio’s original owner would be some
  Palatinate prince. Jan’s connections to the Palatinate are hard to pin down but
  they certainly existed. His Scipio left its trace in the Frankenthal area in the
  form of Pieter Schoubroeck’s Continence of Scipio of c.1603: copper, 66 x 115 (Speyer,
  Historisches Museum der Pfalz, inv. #HM 36), a work which strongly suggests that
  the artist had seen Jan’s version of the subject. </p><p>The landscape here clearly
  attempts to envision the setting of New Carthage as described by Livy. To do this,
  Jan drew loosely upon a bay he knew well, the Bay of Naples. Other topographical
  elements, like the island connected to the mainland by an arched bridge, had appeared
  in Jan’s earlier harbor landscapes. See for instance the Harbor with the Preaching
  of Christ of 1598 (panel, 78 x 119, sig. & d.). Munich, Alte Pinakothek, cat. #187;
  Ertz 1979, #46.</p><p>Jan's particular source for his image is Livy, but the tale
  of Scipio is recounted in various ancient texts: Valerius Maximus, Memorable Doings
  and Sayings, trans. D. R. Shackleton. Loeb Classical Library. (Cambridge/London:
  Harvard University Press, 2000), 367; Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, trans. Frank Gardner
  Moore. Loeb Classical Library. (London: Heinemann & Cambridge: Harvard University
  Press, 1970), vol.7, XXVI:xlii-xl, 165-195; Polybius, The Histories, trans. W.R.
  Paton. Loeb Classical Library. (London: Heinemann & New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons,
  1925), X, 16-19.</p>"
