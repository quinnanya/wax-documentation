comment: "<p>Composition forms the basis for left half of a pretty bad version in
  Columbia, Museum of Art, inv. #58.37.42; see now Ertz 2008-20, cat. #414.  The present
  work is an early version of this theme and quite conceptually elaborate. It was
  once attributed to Rottenhammer as were a number of these.</p>"
