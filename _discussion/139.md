comment: "<p>Ertz notes that there are two variants by Momper in which the staffage
  was done by Jan the Younger; these are illustrated in Ertz 2008-10, vol. 4, pp.
  1380 & 1381. I do not believe this, however: the version in Paris, Gal. d'Art St.
  Honore, is a very inferior work that is by neither Momper nor Jan the Younger but
  by a copyist of a finished work. The version in Russia is much better yet the identical
  staffage is odd and makes me suspect that it is a full copy somehow as well, not
  a second collaboration.</p>"
