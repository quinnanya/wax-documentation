comment: "<p>This is a lovely painting but (judging from reproductions) the landscape
  part is just so much less subtle and sophisticated than the Vienna painting to which
  it is compared. The landscape is not a great flat stage-set like that but a bumpy,
  hilly place which is more Vrancx-like. Jan Brueghel would also not do something
  so obvious as stick this little bunch of pathetic flowers smack dab in center, not
  at this point in his career. Another possible JB/Vrancx collaboration was sold Brussels
  8-v-29 #128; photo at RKD. It is closer to the Vienna painting than this one is.</p>"
