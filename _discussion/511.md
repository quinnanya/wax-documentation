comment: "<p>This illustrates the parable of the good and the bad seed: Matthew 13:24-30.</p><p>A
  painting of this image appears in the background of Jan/Van Balen's Allegory of
  Winter (Ertz 2008-10 #531); Ertz thinks this indicates that there was once a painting
  of the subject but that is not the case at all -- images were clearly transformed
  in scale and, no doubt, medium, when being fit into another picture. </p><p>There
  are several painted copies of this work, some of which Ertz has attributed to Jan
  the Younger. One sold Brussels, Pal. des Beaux-Arts Mar.9, 1953 #15 (panel, 53 x
  44); another sold Amsterdam, F. Muller, 15 November 1938 #17 (panel, 59 x 46); page
  on wiki for second of these. Photographs at RKD represent this second work before
  and after restoration.</p>"
