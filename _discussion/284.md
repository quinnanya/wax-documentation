comment: "<p>The Los Angeles-The Hague catalogue from 20006 presents copious evidence
  and argument that this version is the prime one, and that the Hague version is a
  somewhat later copy. They date this one from ca. 1617 but the Hague version ca.
  1621-22. They therefore argue that it is the present version that is depicted in
  Brueghel and Rubens's Sense of Taste (Madrid) which is dated 1618.</p>"
