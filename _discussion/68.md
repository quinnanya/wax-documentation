comment: '<p>By the time he sent this Allegry of Water to Borromeo, Brueghel had been
  producing this kind of allegory for more than a decade. There are two allegories
  of water in particular that precede this, one in the Lyons series and one that was
  sold Sotheby''s London 18.vii.99 #53.  This one differs significantly from the others
  in that instead of a little nymph he shows a grizzled old man.  Probably this was
  to satisfy Borromeo''s feelings against nudes in paintings. </p><p>The Milan"Allegory
  of Water" is part of a series of the elements which Jan Brueghel painted between
  1608-1621. See Also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/earth-paradise-landscape-paris-louvre">Earth:
