comment: "<p>There is an inscription by feet of Ulysses which reads SEDET AETERNUM
  QUE SEDEBIT JFOELIX and by feet of Circe one that reads TVNC CEDE MALIS: SED CONTRA
  ADVENTIOR. I believe this to be the painting described in Francesco Maria del Monte's
  1627 inventory as “Una tavola di mano di Bruculo nella quale vi e una Donna con
  un’Dardo con alcuni putti, et altre cose...” (Frommel 1971, 37). This work is Jan’s
  only early copper painting that is larger than the standard 25 x 35 size. The picture
  in Del Monte’s inventory is also larger than his other Jan Brueghels, listed as
  2.25 palmi while the others are around 1.5 palmi.<br />The picture is based on a
  print by Giorgio Ghisi after (acc. Bartsch) Luca Penni, from 1561. There is another
  painting taking off from that same print filed at the RKD under Herri met de Bles.</p>"
