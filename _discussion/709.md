comment: "<p>This is a variant of #188, possibly autograph.  I looked at good photo
  at RKD and thought the execution was not as good as the Doria Pamphilj version.
  There is at least one other that could come from the studio, the formerly Goudstikker
  painting (Ertz 191). If the Doria Pamphilj one was shipped off to Rome (a large
  work on copper, surely done for a patron), I wonder how later duplicates got made;
  perhaps a case of beginning them all at the same time and then finishing as buyers
  appeared. The one Ertz now has as 190 is not genuine.</p>"
