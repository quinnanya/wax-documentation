comment: "<p>A very interesting picture that does not make sense as a Jan Brueghel
  but is an intriguing pastiche that includes elements of his work. The rocks are
  clearly related to his very earliest small works on copper (though in reverse).
  The figures at the shore derive, I am pretty sure, from the work of Joachim Beuckelaer
  or his followers! Other landscape elements like the trees in midground and distance
  are all wrong for Jan. The scales of some of the figures are off and their heads
  and faces are weak. It is also odd, I think, for such a small fine work that derives
  in some way from Jan to be done on panel.</p>"
