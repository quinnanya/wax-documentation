comment: "<p>This work was formerly attributed by Ertz to Jan the Younger. Copy (with
  somewhat simplified background) in Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlungen, inv. #6408
  (copper, 22 x 28); is this the copy thought to be entirely by Rottenhammer? Page
  on wiki. Awful copy formerly art market, Vienna 1924 (copper, 26 x 33) from whence
  to private collection Chicago (Sam McDowell).  Variant in reverse sold London (Sotheby's
  17.xi.82 #6), photo RKD. </p><p>Ertz 2008-10 notes (p.663-5) that there is an Allori
  Christ in Limbo from 1578 in the Galleria Colonna which he implies has been there
  since Jan was there and he could have been inspired by it. </p><p>Recent publications
  on this work have suggested that some of the tortured souls in this cavern at the
  lower right were also provided by Rottenhammer. In Janâ€™s previous images of Limbo
  he had executed the figures in this area himself; he would also copy and vary these
  figures in later works done without a collaborator. While it is not impossible that
  Rottenhammer, knowing the general lay-out of a Brueghel hellscape, could have added
  figures here, the woman in particular looks to me to have a Brueghel face.</p>"
