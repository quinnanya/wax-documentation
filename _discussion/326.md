comment: "<p>If the earlier date is correct Jan might have completed in Milan a work
  begun earlier when both he and Rottenhammer were still in Rome. Spatially the picture
  relates more to the works from 1598 than to the works from 1594, but 1596 is of
  course a plausible date. </p><p>Thomas Fusenig's argument that Juno and the major
  foreground groupings of damned souls (nude and not) are by Rottenhammer is convincing
  but surprising. The groups are not clustered or visually linked; Rottenhammer would
  have had to work on a plate prepared by Jan with a basic compositional sketch, as
  Jan would later do when working with Rubens. Rottenhammer’s figure groupings reappear
  in several Aeneas pictures done at around the same time that seem to be solo efforts
  by Jan. Perhaps he copied them after Rottenhammer’s work in the Juno. It does explain
  how Jan knew Tintoretto’s figures from San Rocco, having never visited Venice.</p>"
