comment: "<p>I have examined this painting and believe the last digit of the date
  to be an 8, although Ertz sees the date as 1600. The later dating helps explain
  how it was that Hendrick van Balen, not a very active of stellar painter before
  1600, suddenly was doing an unusually large and expert work probably on commission
  -- ie., he didn't.</p>"
