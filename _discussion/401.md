comment: "<p>On all the variants of the Peasant Wedding Dance by Jan, Pieter the Younger,
  print-makers etc see Currie & Allart 2012, 573-613. A possibility that they don't
  really entertain is that Jan used elements from his father's studio estate to produce
  a drawing/cartoon for the present Bordeaux painting, which predates all his brother's
  versions, and that Pieter the Younger then used his brother's work as one basis
  for his own many variants. Some of Pieter the Younger's works, like the one in Brussels,
  are very close to Jan's picture but in reverse. Currie and Allart argue instead
  that there was another now lost painting by Pieter the Elder but I don't see that
  as necessary.</p>"
