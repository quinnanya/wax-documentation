comment: "<p>Does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalog.<br />This small painting seems
  to be in rather poor condition and I hesitate about making an attribution; however,
  it certainly does derive from Jan's drawing in the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen
  in Rotterdam (inv. # Jan Brueghel de Oude 5, 20.1 x 28.8). The drawing is dated
  1596. See W.W. Robinson in Washington/New York 1986-87, cat. #22.</p>"
