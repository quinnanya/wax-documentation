comment: '<p>According to Díaz Padrón 1985, the two paintings were part of a group
  of works ordered in 1623 by Queen Isabelle de Bourbon, the wife of Philip IV, to
  decorate her apartments, "la Torre de la Reina." They were paid for by the Marquis
  de Malpica at the initiative of the Duchess of Gandía in the same year. Citing:
  Archives Philip IV, liasse 123. </p><p>Vergara 1999 agrees that very little of Rubens''s
  own work can be seen in this copy although it was important, along with the other
  works in this shipment to Isabelle, in giving the Spanish court a sense of Rubens''s
  artistic value.</p><p>A copy signed by J. Boets and dated 1660 (Canvas, 135 x 200)
  was sold Paris: Artcurial, March 26, 2014.</p>'
