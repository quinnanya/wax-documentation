comment: <p>On Holy Water Stoup, of which this is part, see discussion for <a href="/janbrueghel/procession-in-the-winter">Procession
  in the Winter</a>. The present composition is related to the Munich Calvary of 1598.
  This work didn't enter Borromeo's collection until 1616 and Pijl says that it is
  indeed later than the other works in the ensemble, but Ertz still dates it to 1606
  and does not explain why it took so long to reach Borromeo.</p>
