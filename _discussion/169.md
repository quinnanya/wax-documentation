comment: "<p>Copy that looks to me much later in Basel, Museum, inv. #1514 as H. van
  Balen (panel, 46.5 x 74. </p><p>Although Ertz argued for collaboration by Frans
  Snyders in this piece, Neumeister in Munich 2013 says that the execution of the
  animals etc. is all consistent with Jan's work which makes sense; Robels had already
  said that Snyders never collaborated with Jan, which seems to be true.</p>"
