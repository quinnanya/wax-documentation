comment: "<p>Weak variant sold Paris (Hotel George V, December 9, 1996 #17), copper,
  36.5 x 50.5. </p><p>The leopards in the this painting are based on a study by Rubens
  which he would only use himself in around 1617-18. Held suggested an earlier date
  for that work, the (lost) Leopards and Satyrs, because he could not believe that
  Rubens didn’t execute a painting before allowing Jan to use the drawing, but there
  is no reason to think this. Held, ‘P.P. Rubens’ “The Leopards”.</p>"
