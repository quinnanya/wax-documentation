comment: "<p>Ertz 2008-10 claims that this is identical to #370 in his 1979 catalog
  but apparently this is wrong; Werche has compared images of the two and sees several
  visible differences in both artists' contributions to the paintings. So the present
  painting is NOT Ertz 1979 #370 but IS Ertz 2008-10 #484.</p><p>This and other variants
  are closely related to the Munich painting on which Brueghel evidently collaborated
  with Pieter van Avont. This suggests that Jan's workshop was producing very similar
  paintings of the same size, on the same support, at the same time, with different
  collaborators. There must have been thorough pattern drawings. A drawing for part
  of the garland is now in Antwerp.</p>"
