comment: "<p>Simplified variant sold London (Sotheby's 8.iv.81) possibly claiming
  to be JBI; see catalogue.  This was resold Paris (Drouot, 24.vi.94 #65) as JBI.
  \ It's copper, 20.8 x 28.8; composition is in between this & Ertz 1979 #99.  Another
  variant, oil on copper, 36.3 x 55.3, sold Sotheby's London 28 October 2004  #23.
  \  It uses landscape of this one but figure group is, as catalog says, based on
  a drawing in Hamburg reproduced Ertz 1979 p.134, fig.140.</p>"
