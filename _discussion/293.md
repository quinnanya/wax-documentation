comment: "<p>Building based on the several drawings he did in 1590s of this monument.
  \ Very, very loose variant (with a lot less water!) in Swiss private collection.
  \  Fairly good variant  (but not good enough to be studio, the faces are stone ugly)
  sold Christies London, July 5 1985 #13 (copper, 25.5 x 36.9), supposedly sig. &
  d. 160(7?)?  This one was published by Ertz in Paris 1986 as genuine:  Lake Landscape
  with Scipio's Tomb, cat. #8. Variant attributed to Jan II in Dresden, weak copy
  of which in Brera, Milan.</p>"
