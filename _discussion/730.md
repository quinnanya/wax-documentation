comment: "<p>Jacques Foucart, in his 1981 review of the Brussels Bruegel Dynasty show,
  said that that was not the same painting as the one inventoried in Brussels in 1659.
  Presumably there is something in the Louvre documentation that proves this.</p><p>Quite
  large for a copper painting -- one of largest Jan ever did on copper. Curiously
  he did a Marriage of Peleus and Thetis with Van Balen at around the same time also
  on a large copper plate, about same size. This is a complicated collaboration; Ertz
  too notes that the artists must have sent the plate back and forth quite a bit (p.
  806).</p>"
