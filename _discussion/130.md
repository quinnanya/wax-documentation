comment: "<p>Note that in 1597-8, when Jan probably painted this work, the original
  would have been in the collection of Abraham Ortelius to whom Pieter Bruegel had
  left it in his will. Ortelius died in 1598. Note that the original work is quite
  small for a Pieter I, even slightly smaller than this copy.</p>"
