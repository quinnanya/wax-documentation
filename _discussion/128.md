comment: <p>Pijl and Ertz say that this work must have been done around 1605 as a
  long-distance collaboration. Borggrefe follows earlier writers in maintaining that
  the date is around 1595; he calls it Jan's first flower painting. It is not mentioned
  in the Brueghel/Borromeo correspondence. In his Musaeum Borromeo says it's by Rottenhammer
  and that Brueghel has "added" flowers.</p>
