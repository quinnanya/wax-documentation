comment: '<p>According to the 2012 auction lot notes, an anonymous copy of <a href="/janbrueghel/feast-of-the-gods-with-marriage-of-bacchus-and-ariadne">Feast
  of the Gods with Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne</a> is currently housed in the
  Hermitage Museum. Another copy by Hendrick van Balen is in Leipzig, at the Museum
  der bildenden Kunste. The seated female figure seen from the back is a reversal
  of a figure painted by Rottenhammer in an earlier Feast of the Gods, <a href="/janbrueghel/marriage-of-neptune-and-amphitrite-feast-of-the-gods-by-the-sea">Marriage
  of Neptune and Amphitrite: Feast of the Gods by the Sea</a>, (also in the Hermitage
  Museum, inv. #688). Additionally, Klaus Ertz posited that the female goddess seated
  next to Bacchus in this painting could be Ceres, rather than Ariadne.</p>'
