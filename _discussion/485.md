comment: "<p>The Honig Database has rejected the attribution of this painting to Jan
  Brueghel the Elder. It is a copy, possibly from Jan's studio, of Ertz #54. </p><p>Please
  note that the data in the 2008 Ertz catalogue for this painting does not correspond
  to this work in particular but to another one also located in The Hermitage.</p>"
