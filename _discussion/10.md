comment: "<p>The general disposition of the composition has been linked to the Brussels
  watercolor Adoration of the Magi sometimes attributed to Pieter the Elder. However,
  I do not find this connection particularly close. Not a single direct citation can
  be found between that painting and Janâ€™s versions of the subject, in marked distinction
  to the way he handles the revision of other major compositions by his father.</p>"
