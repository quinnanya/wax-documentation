comment: "<p>This is an awful painting.  It is by somebody who knows the Munich Fall
  of Man and other, later paradise paintings by Jan:  it has the Rubens lion and other
  later animals.  The figure painter is totally inept.  Yet it almost certainly must
  have emerged from Jan's workshop because, as noted in Munich 2013 p.154, and infrared
  examination of their painting shows that the donkey at the left edge was originally
  positioned like the one in the present work; therefore the painter must have known
  the earlier original at a preliminary stage of its production.</p>"
