comment: "<p>This is a neat little painting but over on the left-hand side the brushwork
  is way too heavy and schematic; I also don't believe that Jan Brueghel would have
  made this egregious mistake about where the reflection of the house falls in the
  water. I would therefore say that this is not an original composition by Jan Brueghel.</p>"
