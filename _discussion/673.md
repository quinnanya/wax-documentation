comment: <p>The dating of this piece to 1595 indicates that Jan Brueghel was still
  on Rome when it was painted. It was in a Barberini collection by 1623 (Bedoni 61-63;
  sale catalogue Sotheby's) and could have originally been intended for a patron related
  to that family; or it may have been purchased by Maffeo Barberini in 1620s in Rome.
  The relevant inventory lists other works by Brueghel in the same room with this
  one. </p><p>This painting is also the earliest version of a composition he would
  later expand upon in several more New Testament scenes while back in Antwerp. Closely
  related to "Harbor with Preaching of Christ" (Ertz/Honig 33) although using a different
  narrative, as well as distantly related to the 1598 " Sea Harbor with Preaching
  of Christ".</p>
