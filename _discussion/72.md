comment: '<p>This painting of the "Allegory of Winter" is part of a four-piece series
  of the seasons. Please see:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-summer-neuburg-an-der-donau">Allegory
  of Summer (Neuburg an der Donau)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-spring-neuburg-an-der-donau">Allegory
  of Spring (Neuburg an der Donau)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-autumn-neuburg-an-der-donau">Allegory
  of Autumn (Neuburg an der Donau)</a></li></ul><p>Jost and then Freedberg suggested
  that Frans II Francken had participated in the execution of this picture, painting
  the pair of figures seated at the table, but Ertz, Werche, and now Neumeister all
  feel that Van Balen executed all the figures here as in the other three pictures
  in the series. True that this is a more complex collaboration than others in series,
  and more difficult to distinguish hands. I don''t see why Van Balen couldn''t have
  done main figures at table, though. On the other hand, the figures in the shadows
  behind the table, a group of musicians, seem entirely different from the other,
  Van Balenish figures. They look as if Brueghel could have painted them. </p><p>Copy
