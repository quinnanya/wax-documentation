comment: <p>There are many variants of this painting of Mariemont Castle (Ertz 1979,
  Diaz Padron 1992). See for example <a href="/janbrueghel/archduke-albert-before-mariemont-castle-germany">Archduke
  Albert before Mariemont Castle, Germany</a>, the Richmond <a href="/janbrueghel/landscape-with-archduke-albert-and-mariemont-castle">Landscape
  with Archduke Albert and Mariemont Castle</a>, and the Madrid <a href="/janbrueghel/the-archdukes-and-company-before-mariemont-castle">The
  Archdukes and Company before Mariemont Castle</a>. Ertz implies that the Richmond
  version is the prime (Ertz 1979, p. 177).<br />The present work is really immense
  for Jan, surely one of the largest that he did independently.</p>
