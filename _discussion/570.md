comment: "<p>Jan's part of this painting is quite elaborate and extensive.  There
  seem to be several negro figures, one a page with a hawk and hound.  I suppose that
  these are drawn from representations of <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> and are here
  to represent the universality of Babel's original building team.</p>"
