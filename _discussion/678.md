comment: "<p>Ertz thinks that this work is the pendant to Ertz 2008-10 cat. #354;
  Werche agrees. </p><p>Copy sold Paris (Tajan) June 22, 2006, #18 as Jan the Younger
  and studio of Van Balen (panel, 53.5 x 81). </p><p>Ertz originally thought that
  Snyders was involved in the execution of this work but Robels disputed that. There
  is a Hollar print related to the hunting gear in this painting.</p>"
