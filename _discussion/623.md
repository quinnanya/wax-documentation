comment: "<p>Two related drawings in the Rijksmuseum, Inv. #s A 130 and A 131, cataloged
  as copies after Pieter the Elder. </p><p>Ertz calls this work a watercolor on panel
  but that is not a possible technique. However, mixing some watercolor with oil paint
  is not uncommon. If Jan did this here, perhaps he was inspired by a watercolor painting
  by his father. As described by Jan the Younger at his estate sale, Jan had owned
  a “waterverf doec van mynen grootvader” which was valued at fl.300, higher than
  any works except for some flower garlands: Denucé, Brieven en documenten, 140. Perhaps
  this was the “Peasant Fight.” It could also have been his father’s version of the
  Wedding Procession, which might explain why the quite oblong proportions of this
  work are so different from Pieter the Elder’s other images of peasant life, and
  more like his larger watercolor Blind Leading the Blind in Naples. My thanks to
  Odilia Bonebakker for sharing her expertise on technical issues.</p>"
