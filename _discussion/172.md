comment: "<p>The recent Munich catalogue (Munich 2013) lists this painting as a collaboration
  with Rottenhammer. It has previously always been attributed to Van Balen working
  after a drawing by Rottenhammer (Lemgo; Ertz; Werche) and I feel sure that this
  was correct. The faces of the figures are quintessential Van Balen. </p><p>Werche
  lists two copies:  Dijon, Musee des Beaux-Arts, Inv. #CA 162 (canvas, 20.5 x 28.6)
  & Sotheby's London May 16, 1984, #56 (panel, 31 x 40.5).</p>"
