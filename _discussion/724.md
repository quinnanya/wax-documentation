comment: "<p>The painting in center background on the floor, of a warrior in a red
  cap, is the only painting that occurs both in Jan Brueghel's evocations of the collection
  of the archdukes and in Guillam (aka Willem) van Haecht's recreation of the collection
  of Cornelis van der Geest, with the archdukes visiting. My hypothesis is that the
  painting was given as a gift by van der Geest to the archdukes, after he refused
  to sell them the Quentin Matsys Madonna they wanted. The painting of the soldier
  has never been identified.</p>"
