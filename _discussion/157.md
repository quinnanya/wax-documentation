comment: '<p>Information from British Museum website:  Preparatory study for painting
  showing a peasant wedding feast, dated around 1597 (Ertz 2008-10, #566). The present
  drawing, as pointed out by Bastelaer, is a compilation of several earlier prints
  and drawings. The dancing figures in the foreground are derived from the engraving
  ''The Peasant Wedding Dance'' by Pieter van der Heyden after Pieter Bruegel the
  Elder (New Hollstein 44). The watermill in the central background and the buildings
  at right are copied from the drawing showing the Bee-Keepers at the Kupferstichkabinett
  in Berlin. Although Bastelaer describes the figures in conversation in the left
  foreground as copied from a drawing at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, inv.no.1455
  (another copied version is in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin, inv.no.13216), their
  weak drawing style suggests they were both copied from the Hollar etching [query
  how this is possible??]. This drawing is engraved in reproduction by Hollar in 1650
  (New Hollstein 1087), see 1867,1012.576; it is likely the indentations on the sheet
  were made by Hollar. Hendrik Hondius (New Hollstein 29) earlier copied the figures
  in the foreground in another print dated 1644, see 1871,1209.1037."</p>'
