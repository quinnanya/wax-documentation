comment: <p>Diaz Padron accepts a copy from the Brod Gallery and one exhibited Vienna
  1935 as genuine, but considers a version that was sold by Sotheby's in 1959 and
  a piece in the Muller collection to be studio works. All of these are close variants
  but none, I think, is entirely identical. </p><p>A variant by Jan Brueghel the Younger
  (26.6 x 40.5 cm) combines the flower arrangement here with the vase of flowers from
  <a href="/janbrueghel/flowers-in-a-sculpted-vase-beside-a-wreath-of-flowers-gundelfingen">Flowers
  in a Sculpted Vase Beside a Wreath of Flowers (Gundelfingen)</a>. Paris, De Jonckheere,
  2002.</p>
