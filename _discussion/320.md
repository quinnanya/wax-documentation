comment: "<p>Howarth notes that the date is not fully legible and could be 1583 or
  1593; he thinks that the former is more likely and that the architecture is by Steenwyck
  the Elder. The figures, he agrees, are contemporary with those in the Milan painting
  and so are from ca. 1609.<br />One of the paintings shown in this church appears
  to be Willem Key's The Penitent Sinners, painted for the pedlars' altar; it disappeared
  from Antwerp cathedral between 1581 and 1585. The architecture here does not faithfully
  represent the cathedral, though.</p>"
