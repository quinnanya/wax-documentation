comment: '<p>The figures of the Nativity-scene derive from another composition, see
  the print of Hieronymus Wierix for Nadal, Jer√≥nimo. Evangelicae Historiae Imagines.
  Antwerpen: Martinus Nutius, 1593, or a copy after this. In the copy after Hieronymus
  Wierix the Nativity is placed in a Cave (according database Rijksmuseum, inv. no.
  of print: <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.332861" target="_blank">RP-P-OB-67.129</a>).
  1593 could be a terminus post quem for the painting, if the composition by Wierix
  is not overtaken from an older model. </p><p>The composition of figures was also
  used for a painting, now attributed to the circle of Gillis Coignet, RKD, <a href="https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/116968"
