comment: "<p>This painting is a copy of the version in Hampton Court. It is possible
  that it was copied within Brueghel's studio, but that is not really typical of his
  production methods, which run to studio variants rather than replicas. To me, it
  seems more likely that it was copied outside the studio. There are areas of the
  surface that are just not very lively, and the spatial relations feel uncertain.
  I have not seen the work in person, though.</p>"
