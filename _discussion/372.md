comment: '<p>I believe that this was somehow a pendant of Prado #1440, which has also
  been suggested but not pursued by Ertz and others. They are the same in one dimension
  (and their dimensions are unique for Jan) and could have been meant for a specific
  site. In the 1772 inventory this one was paired with a work by Jan Wildens (Prado
  #1896); those two are indeed of the same size and could be joined by the theme of
  water since the Wildens shows the waters of Spa, near tours(Sutton has pointed this
  out as well). In that work the staffage may be by Vrancx. But for the present work,
  the other Momper/Brueghel work is a much more logical pairing. Or perhaps the three
  were a set originally (separated by the time of the inventories below) and the theme
  was something about the health of country living?</p><p>In the 1700 inventory of
  the Zarazuela there is a listing as follows:  "Dos paises de dos varas y media en
  cuadros flamencos con variedad de figuras, y en el uno hay unas lavanderas con ropa
  tendida, tasadas a 60 doblones cada una, pieza quinta, nums 66 y 67."<br />At the
  Alcazar it is described, in 1772, as follows: "Dos paises iguales, el uno con un
  lavadero y tendedero de ropa y otro en que exponen un mapa a una se√±ora, originales
  flamencos de la escuela de Brueghel de dos varas de largo y ona vara y tercio de
  caida."<br />The two were valued at 40,000 reales in 1794 in the Queen''s inventory,
  and at 60,000 in 1834, as works by Jan Brueghel.</p>'
