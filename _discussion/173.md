comment: "<p>Copy sold Berlin (Lepke) May 8, 1906 #41 (panel, 25 x 38)</p><p>There
  had been suggestions that the landscape here was by Alsloot, who did often collaborate
  with De Clerck. But there is a version of the same subject at the Prado by Alsloot
  and De Clerck and Ertz is correct to point out that it has an entirely different
  landscape from the present work, which is much more like a Brueghel landscape. Still,
  this is an unusual work for Jan, an unusual size and more oblong format than most
  of his compositions.</p>"
