comment: <p>There are many variants of this painting of Mariemont Castle (Ertz 1979,
  Diaz Padron 1992). See for example the Richmond <a href="/janbrueghel/landscape-with-archduke-albert-and-mariemont-castle">Landscape
  with Archduke Albert and Mariemont Castle</a>, the Dijon <a href="/janbrueghel/landscape-with-mariemont-castle">Landscape
  with Mariemont Castle</a>, and the Madrid <a href="/janbrueghel/the-archdukes-and-company-before-mariemont-castle">The
  Archdukes and Company before Mariemont Castle</a>.  Ertz implies that the Richmond
  version is the prime (Ertz 1979, p. 177).<br />What Ertz doesn't mention in calling
  these works variants of one another is that the others are huge works on canvas
  whereas the present version is a tiny copper miniature. The sequence of making is
  clearly established because the first two versions show Mariemont before the additions
  to the building, and this tiny miniature shows it in its new state as also does
  the Madrid Five Senses series.<br />Freedberg, in his review, doubts this attribution.
  I disagree.</p>
