comment: "<p>Ertz lists an autograph replica of this painting in his 2008-10 catalogue,
  #324. Another Hell scene of roughly the same size (27 x 36) on copper was sold in
  Paris (Charpentier, March 24 1953, #8). Judging from the poor reproduction available
  it seems to have been close to a Jan Brueghel if not an autograph work. If it is
  genuine, either it or the replica of Borromeo’s painting could have been the Hell
  scene owned by Benedetto Giustiniani: see Silvia Danesi Squarzina, “The Collection
  of Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani. Part I” The Burlington Magazine 139/1136 (Nov.
  1997), 771.</p>"
