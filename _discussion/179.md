comment: '<p>Both Ertz and Luk Pijl claim that the "picture with animals" mentioned
  in Brueghel''s letters of 1606-8 must be some lost work because the description
  is too vague to identify with any particular painting, and the current work must
  actually date from c. 1615 on stylistic grounds. This is quite a stretch: the animals
  in the present work are clearly related to ones in earlier paradise landscapes and
  not at all to the ones he was executing by ca. 1615. Furthermore, Jan stresses in
  his letters that the "picture with animals" is the same size as his (first) flower
  painting for Borromeo, which is the case for the Louvre painting and is not Jan''s
  standard size. I am therefore certain that the Louvre painting is Jan''s "picture
  with animals" of 1606-7. Crivelli had identified the present work as being the one
  mentioned in Jan''s letters of 1606-8: pp. 94-97.</p>'
