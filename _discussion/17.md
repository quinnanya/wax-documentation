comment: "<p>Munich 2013, p.174, suggests a later date of ca. 1597 for this work but
  the reasons don't seem necessary; in particular, Jan was certainly doing hell/underworld
  scenes before 1598. </p><p>Copy by a follower, with different staffage, formerly
  art market Germany 1978 (copper, 20.5 x 29.5).  Variant with quite different landscape
  and similar figures--rearranged--formerly art market, London (Christie's 18/19.vii.74
  #219) (panel, 24 x 32)--not in Ertz. Copy accepted by Ertz as original (his 327)
  in private collection, copper, 18.5 x 25.5  </p><p>Related drawing in Darmstadt,
  Hessisches Landesmuseum, inv. #AE 397, signed and dated 1594 gives terminus post
  quem for this painting. Drawing too shows Castel sant' Angelo, bridge, St. Peter's,
  and other recognizable landmarks.</p>"
