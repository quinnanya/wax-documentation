comment: "<p>Related painting exhibited as Hammer Collection at Greenville S.C., Bob
  Jones University, 1957 as Bril and Rottenhammer: copper, 25 x 34.</p><p>Ertz had
  dated this to 1600 or after, but the Munich catalogue argues for an earlier date
  (1595-97), as had Schlichtenmaier on the basis of the Rottenhammer elements. I agree
  that the landscape seems very early but I don't see how the flowers could have been
  done in Rome/Milan or just after Jan returned to Antwerp. I am therefore using 1600
  as a compromise date. The angels and flowers are clearly related to the Milan Winter
  Landscape with Angels Strewing Flowers, although the date of that is also disputed.</p>"
