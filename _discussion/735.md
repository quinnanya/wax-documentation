comment: "<p>The signature appears on a boat.</p><p>A related drawing in Edinburgh,
  National Gallery of Scotland; Ertz thinks that this is not a study for the painting
  but a later copy after it. </p><p>Evidently there is a copy that was sold in London
  (Sotheby's November 25, 1970, #103; panel, 55 x 94) which is by an anonymous follower
  again according to Ertz; Weid calls it a work by Jan the Younger.<br />quite good
  copy on canvas (52.5 x 92.5) Wizowitz, Slot, inv. #1771/1591 (photo RKD)</p>"
