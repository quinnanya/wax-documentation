  1617-1618. Please see:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-smell">The

  href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-taste">The Sense of Taste</a></li></ul><p>A loose
  copy with different armor in the left foreground (panel, 75.5 x 115.5 cm) sold London,
  Sotheby''s, July 8, 1998, #144.<br />A studio copy on panel (71 x 115 cm) with a
  clothed Venus in the Bayerische Staatsgemaldesammlungen, inv. #4945. Foremerly in
  the Augsburg Gemaldegalerie, cat. 1912, #2443. On this version see Munich 2013,
  p. 378, cat. #86<br />Another copy with a clothed Venus (panel, 66 x 108 cm), sold
  at auction in Vienna (J.C. von Klinkoseh), April 2, 1889, #27. Part of a series,
  see discussion for <a href="/janbrueghel/the-sense-of-hearing">The Sense of Hearing</a>.<br
  />a copy of the whole series is in a private collection in the United States, attributed
  to Jan the Younger: sold Paris, Drouot (April 20, 1907, #7)<br />A version by Jordaens
  (??) recorded in an engraving by Prenner, "Theatrum Viennae", 1728.<br />Another
  copy with quite a few changes at RKD with no further information:  in it, the Hell
  scene is replaced by a hunt and some of the armor has changed position.</p><p>While
  the large painting of Hell at the upper right is a variation of earlier, much smaller
  works by Jan Brueghel himself, the painting below it is not one of his battle scenes.
  It is a "Destruction of Senacherib" painted by Ch. Schwarz after Hans von Aachen.
  Schwarz''s painting had been owned by Rudolf II and came to Brussels in ca. 1615-16;
  Rubens made a drawing after this painting, now in the Albertina. Other paintings
  on the wall include a Flagellation of Christ, a Martyrdom of St. Lawrence, and a
  small oval genre scene which seems to show a group of men watching a some sort of
  minor surgery.</p>'
