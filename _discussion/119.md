comment: <p>Winkler, Durers Zeichnunen (1937), p.43. suggests that this could have
  been given as a gift by Maria of Bavaria in 1608 for the wedding of Maria Magdalena
  of Austria and Cosimo II of Florence. This painting is itself freely copied from
  DÃ¼rer's drawing "The Great Calvary" which is also in the Uffizi but was presumably
  in Prague when Brueghel was there in 1604.</p>
