comment: '<p>one of 25 paintings sent to queen of Spain.  In 1636, in great room before
  bed chamber where king dines in summer months:  "Otro lienzo del mismo alto que
  el de los Sentidos con molduras de lo mismo, de una casa flamenca en que está la
  señora Infanta y sus damas segando heno y cargándole con un carro."</p><p>Diaz Padron
  attributed landscapes here and in pendant to Momper. Ertz suggested Jan the Younger.
  I don''t think Momper is right; the works were probably done with help from Jan''s
  studio, whether his son or whoever else was working there. It is not plausible that
  Jan would have let his 19-year-old son do a major work for the Spanish court on
  his own.</p>'
