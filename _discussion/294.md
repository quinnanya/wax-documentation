comment: '<p>British Museum website: "This drawing is a preparatory study for some
  details (the ships; two men leaning on the boat; fisherman holding a skate at left)
  in the 1603 painting by Brueghel ''The Large Fishmarket'' in the Alte Pinakothek,
  Munich, inv.no.1889; see K. Ertz, "Jan Brueghel der Ältere: Die Gemälde", Cologne,
  1979, cat.no.91, fig.10. The wash could have been applied later as it does not follow
  the lines of the ship sails correctly; a feature which can be seen in some of Brueghel''s
  drawings. A pen and ink drawing showing the same composition, is now generally considered
  a copy; it is in the Rijksprentenkabinet, Amsterdam; see M. Schapelhouman, ''Nederlandse
  tekeningen omstreeks 1600'', 1987, p.31,under no.18. Literature: M. Winner, ''Zeichnungen
  des Älteren Jan Brueghel'', in Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 3 (1961), Berlin, 1961,
  pp.204-206; A. Van Camp, in M. Neumeister (ed.), "Breughel: Gemälde von Jan Brueghel
  d. Ä", exh.cat. Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 2013, cat.no.45."</p>'
