comment: '<p>A direct copy on panel in Schwerin, Staatl. Museum, inv. #G21 (19.5 x
  25.5).  Variants in following collections:  Dresden; Brescia; Stockholm; private
  collection germany (panel, 25 x 37); Dutch private collection (copper, 16.3 x 23.8);
  Leipzig; private collection Rotterdam    Photos of lots of variants of varying degrees
  of poorness at RKD.    Some look really lousy and clearly a lot later.  Query how
  some compositions come to enjoy this incredibly replicable status?  Ertz now attributes
  some of copies, like Leipzig one, to Jan the Younger.  He also points out, rightly,
  that a bunch of the variants are copies of one another or rather of one single variant
  which he labels as a "lost JBI"  but which could just as easily have been a Jan
  the Younger surely. Related compositional drawings in Kunsthalle, Bremen and at
  Vassar College.</p>'
