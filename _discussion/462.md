comment: '<p>One of two known autograph version of this composition; the other (Ertz
  1979  #257) is much larger and on panel, dated 1612,.  Dating on present version
  now up in air because 1603 version, which Ertz dated this one as "after", is now
  attibuted to Jan the Younger (Ertz 1979 #094).   So if the present work is original
  we can only date it to before 1612, hence I am saying ca. 1610. (Ertz 2008-10 calls
  it 1603-12)</p><p>Other copies attributed to Jan the Younger are:</p><ul><li>EJBII
  #34:  private collection (panel, 38.5 x 62.3) </li><li>EJBII #35:  Antwerp, KMSK,
  formerly Ertz #94</li></ul><p>Other variants not attributed to Jan the Younger:</p><ul><li>Formerly
  art market, London (Christie''s 1965)</li><li>Formerly Munich, Alte Pinakothek,
  #2878:  now I think Hartford, Wadsworth Atheneum (copper, 22.5 x 31.5--sloppy but
  not incompetent.)</li><li>Kiel, Kunsthalle</li><li>Another copy not in Ertz is in
  New York, Metropolitan, inv. #71.82 (panel, 24 x 32) [query is that the painting
  we were sent by W. Liedtke and is genuine?]</li><li>and in collection M. St. J.
  Barne, Sotterly Hall, Beccles, Suffolk (panel, 22 x 30)</li><li>very distant variant
  collection Sir Edmund Bacon, Raveningham Hall, Norwich (copper, 18 x 24)</li><li>variant
  sold Christie''s NY 26.i.01 #46, panel, 31 x 40.3 as Joseph van Bredael; they now
  seem to attribute lots of Brueghel knockoffs to him.</li></ul><p>Loosely related
  to a drawing in the British Museum, which itself copies a drawing by Pieter Bruegel
  in Berlin; see for illustrations Ertz 2008-10, p.248.</p>'
