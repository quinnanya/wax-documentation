comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Possibly a copy after a detail from an unidentified
  painting by Jan Brueghel (not in K. Ertz, "Jan Brueghel der Ältere: Die Gemälde",
  Cologne, 1979).<br />An attribution to Willem van de Velde is suggested on the back
  of the sheet. Attributed to Jacob Matham in the manuscript catalogue of the Sloane
  inventory."</p>'
