comment: "<p>In my opinion, the two paintings, this from 1599 and the replica in Mainz,
  with Abraham and Isaac, passing woodcutters on the way for the sacrifice on Mount
  Moriah, could illustrate almost identical sentences in the gospels by Matthew (3:7-10)
  and Luke (3:7-9), spoken by John the Baptist. </p><p>Matthew, 3:7-10:<br />But when
  he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them,
  O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring
  forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: And think not to say within yourselves,
  We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
  to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the axe is laid unto the root of
  the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
  and cast into the fire.</p><p>In the Mus√©es des Augustins in Toulouse is another
  painting by a follower (?) of Jan Brueghel with the same topic, Abraham and Isaac
  on the way to the sacrifice with woodcutters, but complete different composition,
  inv. no. 858.<br />Bartilla 2005, pp. 133-134.</p>"
