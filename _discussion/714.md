comment: '<p>This is one of those basic pattern pieces that gets copied and altered
  many many times. The following notes are based on Ertz 1979.<br />A variant not
  mentioned by Ertz (and a very bad one, too) formerly in the Dragor collection, Denmark,
  col. G. Sadolin [RKD JB L1].  Two more unmentioned but OK variants are:  formerly
  art market, Paris (Charpentier, 12.v.48 #27, panel, 20 X 30.5) and formerly art
  market, Paris (Galliera 20.vi.61 #66, copper, 21 x 22).  Variants Ertz does list
  are his #106 in Toledo from 1604 (see below) and his #95 in Turin dated perhaps
  1603 which isn''t really a variant.  Then there are three more possibilities--ones
  he doubts attribution of but could be studio variants:  his #141 is indeed a quite
  close take-off of this Wellington painting, while the other two he doesn''t illustrate.  There
  are also two works he identifies as variants by "followers", one in Amsterdam and
  other in a private collection.  The Amsterdam one is now identified by Ertz as a
  Jan the Younger (Ertz JBII #31:  copper, 14.5 x 20.5; RKD BL1 as JBI) supposedly
  done before Jan the Younger left for Italy.   One of these copies was sold Sotheby''s
  London December 5 2007 as being by a follower/studio of JB, with its pendant Ertz
  #152, also on copper and dated 1607.  This is exactly the sort of work that could
  be by the studio.  It really isn''t a copy at all of the Wellington picture but
  a quite bad pastich-y variant. </p><p>Condition: small areas of damage upper right
  and left, otherwise good (from collection catalog). I have changed measurements
  from Ertz''s to match those given by the Wellington museum itself. They also note
  that the last 2 digits of the date are not easy to discern.</p>'
