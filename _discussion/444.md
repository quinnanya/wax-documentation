comment: "<p>Brown (in Borggrefe 2008, p.30) notes that you can really see in this
  painting that the landscape was added second; you can distinguish Brueghel's precise
  brushwork from softer, more flowing brushwork of Rottenhammer, and JB's brush strokes
  obscure the contours of HR's figures.  Brueghel also painted the donkey.<br />Brown
  suggests, very plausibly, that Rottenhammer used a cartoon to repeat these figures
  on multiple copper plates which JB then elaborated with landscapes. </p><p>Copy
