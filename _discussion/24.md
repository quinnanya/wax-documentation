comment: '<p>Note on possible early provenance from Sotheby''s:  A painting described
  as "Enea condotto dalla Sibilla negli Elisei, di Brueghel d''Enfer" is listed in
  the 1848 inventory of Giovanni Andrea Colonna, Rome, no. 392. By this date Brueghel''s
  three other versions of this subject (mentioned above) are known to be in their
  current locations, two in the Szepmuveszeti Muzeum, Budapest, and the other in the
  Kaiserhaus, Vienna (later entering the Kunsthistorisches Museum). It is thus possible
  that the present work is identifiable with the Colonna painting. The earlier Colonna
  inventory of 1783, made by Filippo III Colonna, lists only a pair of works described
  as: "Due Quadri di 1 1/2 per traverso, uno rappresentante Orfeo, ed Euridice all''Inferno,
  l''altro Enea agli Elisi = Bruguel Infernale".  Again, the present work may be identifiable
  with the second of the pair, fitting both the description and the dimension (no
  painting identifiable with the former, depicting Orpheus and Euridice, is known
  today and is either lost or the subject was mis-identified by the inventory compiler).
  No painting specifically mentioning Aeneas appears in the 1714 Colonna inventory,
  but the descriptions here are, in general, extremely vague. Whether identifiable
  with the present work or not, the painting mentioned in the 1848 inventory may have
  entered the Colonna collection through marriage, which would explain its non-appearance
  in the 1714 inventory. On the other hand it is conceivable that Cardinal Ascanio
  Colonna, the artist''s patron in Rome from 1592-94, commissioned it directly from
  Brueghel, who had returned to Antwerp two years before its execution, in 1596, and
  the subject is simply unidentified in subsequent inventories.</p>'
