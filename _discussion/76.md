comment: '<p>This is the first documented work (apart from the <a href="/janbrueghel/mouse-rose-and-butterfly-milan">Mouse,
  Rose, and Butterfly (Milan)</a>) sent to Borromeo from Antwerp and it is also one
  of Brueghel''s earliest allegories, following close on the larger and more ambitious
  Vienna version of 1604. The present work is described in a letter of 8 July 1605.
  Brueghel as usual names no collaborator but he does describe its "historia" as Ceres
  with cornucopia of fruit, with 4 putini signifying four elements:  "terra" with
  fruits flowers and animals, water with rare shells and fish and other "bisaria",
  air with birds.  He doesn''t describe fire.  </p><p>Described in a letter from Jan
  Brueghel to Cardinal Borromeo, Crivelli p.50</p>'
