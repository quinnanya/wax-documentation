comment: '<p>This is a variant of the Wellington painting (Ertz 1979 #135). The relation
  between the two is interesting: exactly the same basic scheme but all of the "staffage,"
  even the boats, is different. Perhaps a basic ground laid down according to a pattern,
  but then then the next stage developed differently, even at a different time, by
  studio assistants?<br />There is the mark of Pieter Stas on the back of the copper
  panel.</p>'
