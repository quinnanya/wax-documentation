comment: "<p>Brueghel would significantly alter this basic compositional format of
  a river landscape with a single bank receding into space. He had already explored
  this compositional type in Landscape with a Fishing Village, River Landscape with
  a landing a Village, and A River Scene with Boats Unloading at Quay. Within this
  series of River Landscapes, Brueghel changed the composition by introducing a large
  tree at the junction of the river, allowing him to create a more satisfying spatial
  experience.</p>"
