comment: '<p>Pretty good copy in Basel, Kunstmuseum, inv. #1089 (copper, 33 x 47.5)  Ertz
  formerly attributed this one to Jan the Younger (Ertz #11) but again, if he was
  copying it in 1630s as Ertz suggests, how did he have access to a picture done 30
  years earlier?  Possibly this was one of the "unfinished plates" left by his father.
  Basel painting is now accepted by Ertz (Essen 1997, cat. #33); it still doesn''t
  look that great to me.  Some of the figures are just lousy. If the Basel painting
  is a Jan the Elder and not Younger, it is a workshop version.</p><p>Two further
  variants by unknown followers, one formerly Vienna, Gal. St. Lucas (panel, 38.5
  x 57) and one Gal. de Boer, 1930 (panel, 24.5 x 34.5).<br />Group of farm girls
  here are adapted from [some study for] Pieter Bruegel''s Prague Hay Harvest.</p>'
