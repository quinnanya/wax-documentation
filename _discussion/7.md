comment: "<p>Copy by a follower in Dresden, Gemaldegalerie (panel, 45 x 64.5).  Copy
  art market, Vienna (Hassfurthen 1993) canvas, 76.5 x 110. </p><p>Martin 1970: composition
  was inspired in a general way by Pieter the Elder's Adoration of the Kings in Brussels.
  The cottage, figures at the door, and king kneeling before Christ derive somehow
  from Bosch's Prado Adoration of the Kings. The poses of the Moorish king, St. Joseph,
  the man whispering to him, and the soldier in the center are copied from Pieter's
  London painting of the Adoration of the Kings. The shepherd leaning on a stick by
  hound in right foreground comes from drawing by Pieter the Elder in Dresden.</p>"
