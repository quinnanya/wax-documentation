comment: "<p>Museum has gone on and off about attribution, sometimes calling it an
  autograph work but often listing it as a studio piece. There are no close copies/variants.</p><p>According
  to Fred Meijer, this painting must have been known by Bosschaert by about 1606/7
  because he borrows from it in one of his earliest flower pieces.  This means that
  Brueghel's earliest flower pieces were shipped not just to Borromeo but also  to
  Middelburg.  Probably for flower collectors there.  Bosschaert might have known
  about this painting in his role as a dealer. </p><p>Jan Brueghel the Younger painted
  variants with a similar glass vase: a copper on panel (18.5 x 24.5 cm) sold at auction
  (Van Ham Kunstauktionen), May 16, 2008, nr. 377; and one in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.</p>"
