comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue or in the Honig
  Database.</p><p>The paint was applied with extremely fine brushes and tiny impasto.
  Many of the finer details of the design elements were painted over the underlying
  tone rather than in a space left in reserve. Particularly, the painting and its
  support are in good condition, with only minor abrasion. </p><p>The painting recently
  underwent conservation and preservation treatment in 2000.</p>"
