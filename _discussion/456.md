comment: "<p>There are many examples of this composition. Two were in Ertz 2008-10
  as #s 134 and 135. Another is this one. In the Como/Tel Aviv catalog they claim
  that two more paintings of this composition are in Budapest, one by Jan the Elder
  and one by Jan the Younger. Ertz published the Budapest painting in his 1984 monograph
  on Jan the Younger. These are very charming compositions and could all be by Jan
  the Younger; the ones I can see in good reproduction definintely do not look fine
  enough to be Jan the Elder. There is some very heavy-handed painting in the present
  version and the faces of the figures are, in all versions, not highly characterized
  or persuasive as Jan's. The suggestion that these could have been done while Jan
  was in Italy seems especially unlikely.</p>"
