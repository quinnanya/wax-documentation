comment: "<p>I have a few attribution doubts, because two cows don't look very good
  to me--heavily outlined, and on one the head is too small. Yet density of brushwork
  even in ground plane makes it more likely that this is a real Jan Brueghel.</p><p>There
  is a drawing associated with this painting in Stockholm, Nationalmuseum.  Ertz says
  that Winner had some doubts about this drawing. But here is a strange thing:  in
  the drawing the horses are correct, but in the painting the outer rear one has no
  legs and the inner rear one seems as if none of his feet is touching the ground.
  \ This combined with the cow problem leads me to question this painting, nice as
  it is.  Perhaps a studio work drawing on various discrete model drawings? Oddly,
  in Ertz #72, which repeats same wagon and horses configuration, there are once again
  no legs on that one rear horse.<br />this picture was displayed at TEFAF in Maastricht
  in 1990</p>"
