comment: '<p>The Rome "Allegory of Earth" is part of a series of the elements which
  Jan Brueghel painted between 1606-1611. The series currently resides in the Galleria
  Doria Pamphilj. See Also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-fire-venus-in-the-forge-of-vulcan-rome">Allegory
  of Fire: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-water-rome">Allegory
  of Water (Rome)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-air-rome">Allegory
  of Air (Rome)</a></li></ul><p>All these panels are quite badly warped, especially
  that of Fire.</p><p>This series is variant of one that has been split up (cf. Ertz
  #s 494, 498, 503 & 510). Also variant of full series in Lyons, formerly attributed
  to Jan the Younger but now accepted by Ertz as Jan the Elder.  And there''s been
  another less good copy of whole series on art market in London. Copy of this one,
  Earth, in Ales, Mus. de la Ville.</p>'
