comment: "<p>A copy attributed to Jan the Elder sold in New York, Jan 11, 1979, #114
  as JBI and Van Balen.<br />It is interesting that the better copies/variants of
  this one are around the same size. They vary a lot in quality -- some, like the
  one sold in Paris, are clearly not autograph by either master yet it's a good painting.<br
  />An unfinished version of this work appears propped on a chair in the unattributed
  kunstkammer painting in the London National Gallery. It appears to be larger than
  the Vienna painting, more the size of the present (Madrid) version. In the present
  painting, a clear area of reserve is visible around the foot of earth, leaving process
  of collaborative making unusually clear.</p>"
