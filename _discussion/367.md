comment: "<p>Rubens completed the figures first and then sent the the piece to Jan
  Brueghel to finish the garland. In this is it unlike most of the collaborative works
  by these two, in which Jan seems to have taken the initiative and did the first
  stages of execution. It is also the largest collaboration by Rubens and Brueghel
  and was begun on a panel made up of seven planks, enlarged (as was typical of Rubens)
  by two  more planks during the process of painting.</p>"
