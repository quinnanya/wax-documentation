comment: '<p>Figure in center, who represents Man (as Blankart correctly argued),
  is surrounded further by animals that signify 5 senses:  eagle/sight, deer/hearing;
  dog/smell; monkey/taste, and turtle/touch.  He subjugates taste and touch as the
  basest senses. According to Johnny van Haeften catalogue, following Blankart,  "The
  clear message is that no longer are the senses the dangerous deceivers that they
  were once thought to be, but they are loyal and dedicated servants at the Court
  of Man.  Man, the all powerful, rules these tamed faculties with temperance, here
  symbolized by the tiny pair of compasses held in his right hand." The identification
  Blankart had made of man at table as "Man" is based on a print by A Collaert after
  Adam van Noort, which shows Man with the senses as his dedicated servants:  he needs
  only "temperance" to govern them. Museum brochure uses as comparison Frans Francken''s
  Four Continents allegory in Oldenburg, Landesmuseum, from 1629. Interesting connection
  possibly registering impact of present work?</p>'
