comment: "<p>Brueghel usually painted his flowers directly from nature, without using
  drawings or sketches.<br />There are hardly any preserved flower sketches done by
  him, while landscape drawings remain in infinite supply.<br />He traveled to Brussels
  frequently, to study and paint rare flowers in the Archdukeâ€™s garden.</p>"
