comment: "<p>According to Louisa Wood Ruby, this drawing was inspired by an etching
  by Hieronymus Cock after a drawing by Pieter I now in Prague. Jan may have owned
  either/both the drawing  & print. The present drawing is inscribed: “In Milano 13
  Gennaro 159[3 or 5]”. On the verso, an inscription in a later hand reads: “Brueglo
  1593 en Janvier,”. No other document indicates that Jan was in Milan in early 1593.
  Bedoni & Ruby suggest that Jan could have made such a trip with Borromeo that year.</p>"
