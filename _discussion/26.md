comment: "<p>Quite a lot of copies and variants of this work exist, including Ertz
  1979 #303 which he now attributes to Jan the Younger. Other: Berlin, Gemaldegalerie,
  #688 (panel, 67.8 x 95.5); Werche A 68. Painting in French private collection. Variant
  in Glasgow, Art Gallery.</p><p>There has been some back and forth about both attribution
  and dating on this work and the Berlin version. Ertz accepts current work, attributes
  Berlin version to Jan the Younger. Werche says that both must be by same Brueghel
  and she votes for Jan the Younger; however, she says that style of figures points
  to date of ca. 1608. Therefore her hypothesis is that there was a lost prototype
  by Jan the Elder and Van Balen from ca. 1608 and both of these works must be copies
  from ca. 1625 by Jan the Younger and Van Balen. My impression from good photographs
  was that Berlin painting is not quite as good as present work, and therefore present
  work has some chance of being that original as Ertz now agrees (w/ earlier date).</p>"
