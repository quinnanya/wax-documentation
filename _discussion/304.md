comment: <p>A small painting in very poor condition, judging from the photograph in
  Ertz, but I see no reason to think that under all that varnish and damage there
  lurks a fine picture. Even Christie's, in their catalogue, attributed his to "circle
  of Jan Brueghel I" which seems about right.</p>
