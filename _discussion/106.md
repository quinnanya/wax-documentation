comment: "<p>A close copy of this series of flowers in a Wanli vase by Jan Brueghel
  the Younger (Copper, 48 x 35 cm), is in Madrid, Museo del Prado, #1421 (the Prado
  attributes it to Jan van Kessel the Elder).<br />The Mauritshuis notes (1992) that
  the present work is not in good condition. The version formerly w/ Richard Green
  is in very good condition.</p>"
