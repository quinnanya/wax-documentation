comment: '<p>Susan Merriam notes that this early flower garland differs from those
  made after it (and other flower garlands in general) in its construction: van Balen''s
  figures are painted on silver and inset into Brueghel''s portion. Merriam describes
  the inset portion as "more like a cameo in an elaborate setting than a painting"
  and as having a trompe l''eoil effect that heightens the object''s tactile quality.  See
  Susan Merriam, Seventeenth Century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision,
  and the Devotional Image (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate, 2012), 21-22.  </p><p>Susan
  Merriam and Pamela Jones both cite a letter from Brueghel to Borromeo regarding
  the inclusion of the landscape in the background: "I will not fail to work hard
  on the little painting of the compartment of flowers in which, according to your
  Illustrious Lordship''s orders, I will accomodate the Madonna within the landscape."  (Archival
  Collection:  Lettere deretti al Cardinal Federico Borromeo, Ambros, Ms. G198bis-inf:239)  See
