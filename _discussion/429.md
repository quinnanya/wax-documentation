comment: "<p>Copy in Dresden, inv. #819A (canvas, 110 x 164). Ertz 2000, p.378, attributes
  this to Jan the Younger but it seems at least as likely to have been made within
  Jan the Elder's studio contemporary with the other copies.<br />Although Ertz lists
  the painting as being executed in tempera, Bodo Brinkmann at the museum in Basel
  confirms that it is oil on panel. No paint samples have been taken to determine
  if any added tempera was used, but basically this is an oil painting.</p>"
