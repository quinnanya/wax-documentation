comment: "<p>A close variant of Vienna and London paintings which is now accepted
  by Ertz but it's just not consistent. Some of the figures are really good (the crowd
  is lively and interesting) and others are awful--like, actually the 3 kings are
  all terrible, as if the artist just wasn't interested.  A good example of a studio
  piece: executed alongside or shortly after autograph ones, possibly with some intervention
  of the artist  but not a fully autograph, first-rate piece. Also it's not a direct
  copy--the space where the crowd gathers on the left is not so good (they are too
  isocephalic) and the middle- and background don't repeat any other version exactly.
  You have a sense that there were drawings around that were mixed and matched.</p>"
