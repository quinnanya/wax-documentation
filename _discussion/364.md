comment: "<p>A similar fragment of puttis and a fruit garland (174 x 56 cm) in the
  Prado, Madird, #174, attributed to 'School of Rubens'</p><p>Van Mulders has suggested
  that this could have been the work made for the Duke of Buckingham, who certainly
  owned some sort of Madonna in a Garland. But this connection seems to be just speculation.</p>"
