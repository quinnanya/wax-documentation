  of the City of Rome with the Tiber, Castel Sant'Angelo and St. Peters</a> in numerous
  paintings, including Munich’s <a href="/janbrueghel/large-fish-market-with-self-portrait">Large
  Fish Market with Self Portrait</a> and the <a href="/janbrueghel/aeneas-carrying-anchises-from-the-burning-troy-munich">Aeneas
