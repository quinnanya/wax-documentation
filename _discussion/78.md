comment: "<p>Two closely related versions both in Madrid, one fully autograph by both
  painters (Ertz 1979 #300), the other a collaboration with Jan the Younger. Both
  are considerably larger and painted on panel. </p><p>Faber Kolb argues that this
  painting of 1604, the year that Jan Brueghel travelled to Prague, was probably made
  for Rudolf II in whose collection it was by 1615 according to the inventory of his
  goods to be inherited by Albert and Isabella (De Maeyer p.317); Faber Kolb 2005,
  pp. 52 & 55.</p>"
