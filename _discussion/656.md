comment: "<p>According to Buijs in Lyon 1991, p.30, there was once a whole other putto
  to the main figure's right who was painted out.  Also some birds were changed--ones
  that were utterly finished to the last detail were painted out and replaced by others.
  </p><p>COPIES AND VARIANTS:<br />copper, 68 x 86, very primitive also, sold Cologne
  (Kunsthaus 10.xi.76 #1433); also quite bad is one sold London (Christie's 26.vi.64
  #133, on copper, 25 x 35 in.).  Another truly awful one sold Fieris (?) 7.vii.26
  #17;  another was with G. Cramer in The Hague at some point;  a really dreadful
  one on copper, 54 x 85, in Dublin, National Gallery of Ireland, and another bad
  one in collection Ten Cate, Almelo, in 1975. Ste-Gudule sale, Brussels, March 27,
  1912 (copper, 66 x 87 cm); Dorotheum, Vienna, March 18-21 1912 (canvas, 58 x 71
  cm); St√∂ri, Zurich, December 5, 1924; Fievez, Brussels, July 7-8, 1926 (copper,
  31 x 42 cm); Lepke, Berlin, April 1911 (panel, 57 x 97 cm); Sotheby's London, June
  26, 1964 (copper, 63.5 x 88.9 cm); Christie's London, December 11, 1981 (38.6 x
  56.5 cm); Christie's London, December 13, 1929 (panel, 55.9 x 80 cm). These are
  all different paintings, and all are of varying degrees of awfulness.   Why so many
  very bad copies here?  I think it's mostly the figure painters who are bad, I can't
  tell so much about the birds.<br />There's even one with no figure!--just the birds
  have been copied [id on back of RKD photo only as Wetzlar].<br />A clearly better
  painting is the one sold Christie's London 11.xii.87 #67A:  on panel, 45.5 x 82.5
  cm.   The ground here seems never to have been finished.  Ertz attributes this to
  Jan the Younger around 1630 (before vBalen died).  I don't get this picture, the
  figures seem to be in OK shape but the ground is either unfinished or damaged (it's
  certainly damaged) or both.  Perhaps the figures were repainted later?</p>"
