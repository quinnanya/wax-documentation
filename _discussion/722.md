comment: "<p>Several possible historical inventories mention works that could correspond
  to this. 1764: Sans Souci, Pottsdam, cat. #137. Perhaps thence to the Berliner Schloss
  (1806) and thence to Paris.<br />A painting of the same subject was in the Brussels
  palace inventory in 1650s as a Brueghel/De Clerck collaboration. </p><p>Apparently
  Hendrick van Balen painted a copy of this work also in 1599, formerly in Potsdam.
  It too was in the collection of Friedrich II of Prussia. cf. Brake/Prague, 137.</p>"
