comment: "<p>Wonderful pastiche of Pieter the Elder's famous painting in Jan's style.
  There is something not quite right about it although it is difficult to explain
  in any other way. The central figure in red is very Jan-like but the foreground
  areas are sluggish and I would have expected a better revision of the animals. Background
  is also not obsessive enough in its detail; midground trees are very perfunctory.
  Really it has to be a yes or a no but I'm calling it within Jan's studio pending
  further examination/investigation. I have not seen this work myself.</p>"
