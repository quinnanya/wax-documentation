comment: "<p>The marks on the back indeed consists of the stamp 'MV' by Michiel Vriendt,
  an illegible and abraded Antwerp Brand and the letter 'A'. The latter I have identified
  as a year letter from the Guild year 1621-1622. This would be the year the panel
  was produced. </p><p>See J. Wadum: “The Antwerp Brand on Paintings on Panels”, in
  Looking Through Paintings. The Study of Painting Techniques and Materials in Support
  of Art Historical Research, ed. E. Hermens. Leids Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek XI. Baarn
  and London (1998) 179-198, and especially page 198.</p>"
