comment: '<p>Version of Ertz 1979 #56, with slightly different proportions.   See
  there for other related work. I''m calling this a "b" work which I''m thinking of
  as produced in Jan''s studio possibly concurrently with the prime version but with
  a lesser degree of work by JB himself.  The figures on this one, and a few places
  where animals are integrated into scene, just look less right than one that''s in
  a private collection.</p>'
