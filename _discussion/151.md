comment: "<p>According to Ertz's provenance, the Spanish Royal Collection's inventory
  number was polished off when the painting was cleaned.<br />Ertz dates this 1610
  in relation to his 216 to which is has no relation at all.  It is however clearly
  related to a drawing that Winner has dated 1619, so we will go along with that.
  \ The drawing is in Brussels, MdBA, #484:  Winner 1961, p.210, fig.19.</p>"
