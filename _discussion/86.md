comment: "<p>Attribution of this one has been doubted and it is indeed peculiar in
  the sense that the landscape is a late adaptation of some of Jan's very early forest
  landscape paintings, like Ertz 1979 #2 & 2a. The bridging work between them and
  this would be a painting formerly in a Russian museum (copper, 14.9 x 18.3, photo
  RKD), but I also wonder about the attribution of that one. On the other hand, the
  figures are by Vrancx who was notoriously fussy about not having studio copies of
  his work; so surely he would have insisted on collaborating with Jan himself?</p>"
