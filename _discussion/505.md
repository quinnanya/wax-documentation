comment: "<p>There is a copy of this painting in the Museo Civico, Cremona, illustrated
  in Morandotti, Milano profana nell'et√† dei Borromeo, p.218.  He attributes it to
  a local painter, Carlo Antonio Procaccini; but if so, Procaccini was somehow copying
  after this painting which is by Brueghel.</p>"
