comment: '<p>Although this is not in Ertz, the Honig Database has tentatively attributed
  this painting to the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Landscape looks a lot like
  early Jan, it would be a work done in Italy.  In lower right corner are two classicaly-dressed
  figures walking in wood:  I swear I saw this somewhere as a possibly "Tobias and
  Angel" identification for subject.  True that ruins on left of painting seem rather
  coarsely painted for Jan; who else would have done something like this??  The figures
  seem somewhat damaged.</p>'
