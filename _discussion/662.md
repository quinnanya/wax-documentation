comment: <p>The series of Four Elements for Borromoeo was done around the same time
  as these other two but it was not originally intended as a series, that is, "Earth"
  had a different function (as a history painting) before it was turned into an element
  allegory. That's why it is so different from the "Earth" pictures in the the other
  two series, while the other 3 elements are relatively (although by no means entirely)
  similar between the series. Buijs in Lyons 1991 comments, correctly, that the landscapes
  in this series are more "modern" than in the Borromeo series.</p>
