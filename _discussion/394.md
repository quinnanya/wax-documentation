comment: "<p>Ertz (2008-10, p.764) lists a copy attributed to Frederick van Valckenborch
  in a private collection, copper, 27.5 x 37, illustrated in MÃºllenmeister 1978, vol.3,
  nr. 464. This seems extremely unlikely to me.</p><p>The horse in this painting is
  awkwardly sized somehow. It shows how Jan is struggling to find some formula to
  heroize the horse, which had not been a very strong animal in his early paradise
  landscapes but would become one with help from Rubens's studies later on. In this
  one I think he's looking at drawings he might have done of Titian's Adoration of
  the Magi from Borromeo's collection.</p>"
