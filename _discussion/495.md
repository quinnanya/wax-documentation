comment: '<p>Figures here in lower right corner are indeed the same as in a painting
  by Paul Bril, Harbor at Night with Lighthouse, in Vienna dating from 1601.  Ertz,
  p.93, says that Jan must have taken his staffage from a drawing by Bril.  He  is
  known to have copied a drawing by Matthijs Bril.   Some boat in this picture is
  also copied from Bril.  It''s been suggested (Russell 1992) that the present work
  is by Cornelis Liefrinck II and copies a work by his father Hans II, or is a variant
  on it.    I''ve looked at the only known works by Cornelis and I don''t believe
  this is by him.  It''s too refined. Bril connection actually ends up backing Pijl/Ertz''s
  argument.  I mean, how could this Leiden Liefrinck guy have known about the Bril
  drawing or painting?  Russell thinks that Hendrick Vroom somehow made the connection--he
  knew Bril in ROme in the 1580s.  But she that''s even more tenuous than Ertz''s
  idea of a lost drawing that JB could have copied-it relies on both a lost drawing
  and an uncertain intermediary.  </p><p>Pijl has examined this painting himself and
  says it is definitely by JB.  The painting Russell says is monogrammed by Hans Liefrinck
  II has clearly been tampered with to make it into a JB.  Oddly, when it was sold
  at Christie''s NY (22.v.98 #50) it was tentatively attributed to Hans Liefrinck
  II [or anon. Flemish] but the monogram on it clearly now reads IB.  I have looked
  closely at catalog illustration, which is very clear, and compared it the present
  work as illustrated in Ertz 1979. The putative Hans Liefrinck is a clearly inferior
  work.  Everything about it is less alive, less clever, less detailed--from ship
  in foreground to very distant background and way light is treated there.  So the
  putative HL is NOT a JB.  I do not understand its relationship to Ertz #1, which
  Pijl says IS a JB and I''m inclined to believe him.  I am going, however, to deattribute
  also the Indiannapolis seascape, or I''m going to put it as a "q" number.   God
  knows who was knocking off Ertz #1, but it wasn''t [only] JB himself.</p>'
