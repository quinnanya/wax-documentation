comment: '<p>This type of oil sketch is also done in more "planning" way by Jan the
  Younger and his works offer us some insights about whole studio process.  Some of
  these are in Ertz--see cat. #333 of his Jan the Younger book.  A painting of the
  Tower of Babel by Jan the Younger and Josse de Momper that actually uses that oil
  sketch was auctioned at Christie''s London (6 July 2006, #14). Important evidence
  of how collaborative thinking worked.</p>'
