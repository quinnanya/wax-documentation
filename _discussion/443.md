comment: "<p>In this painting and Ertz 1979 #10, the portions of the works done by
  Rottenhammer are exactly the same but Brueghel's landscapes make them into two quite
  different works. This would be to imply that Rottenhammer did his part first and
  then sent them to Jan to develop; can we tell if this is true? If the reverse were
  the case it would be extremely odd that Brueghel would paint two quite different
  works and Rottenhammer would put identical figures into each. This version is less
  lush than the other but more detailed.</p>"
