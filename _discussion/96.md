comment: '<p>Description in Diego Duarte collection, Antwerp 1682:  "No 62 Een stuck
  op paneel denslagh van de Amasoonen vol werekx van syn vroege manier.  Het landtschap
  offte verschiet is geheel van den Fluweelen Bruegel, guld.100."  (#62: a piece on
  panel the battle of the Amazons with many details in his [Rubens''s] early manner.
  The landscape or distance is entirely by [Jan] Velvet Brueghel. 100 guilders) </p><p>The
  Potsdam picture has been slightly overpainted to make the figures more modest.</p><p>Has
  been attributed to Otto van Veen, clearly wrongly.<br />Of the two versions of this
  subject, the Potsdam one is probably the "prime," although that is a difficult concept
  when it comes to his studio methods. </p><p>Overall composition very loosely based
  on a print after Giulio Romano''s Battle of Constantine at the Milvian Bridge (Vatican);
  engraved in the 16th century by the Monogrammist SK.</p>'
