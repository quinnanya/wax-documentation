comment: '<p>British Museum website: "This study sheet is probably cut from a larger
  composition; for possible other fragments of the same sheet see also SL,5236.57a
  (<a href="/janbrueghel/small-study-of-a-woman">Small Study of a Woman</a>), SL,5236.57b
  (<a href="/janbrueghel/small-study-of-three-figures">Small Study of Three Figures</a>)
  and SL,5236.57c (<a href="/janbrueghel/small-study-of-a-man-to-right-with-a-fishing-rod">Small
  Study of a Man to Right with a Fishing Rod</a>).<br />Although attributed to Jan
  Brueghel by Hind, the somewhat uninspired and ''flat'' style and the rigidness of
  the lines in this group of four drawings, point more towards the work of a copyist.
  Brueghel''s figures are usually characterised by a more spontaneous application
  of the pen, with some of his figures defined by only a few strokes. Firmly attributed
  sheets with figure studies by Jan Brueghel can be found for example in the Mus√©es
  Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, inv.no.478 and in the Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth,
  inv.no.676."</p>'
