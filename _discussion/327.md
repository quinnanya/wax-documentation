comment: "<p>From poor reproduction this seems like a very weak painting, although
  there was a much worse version of it sold at Sotheby's London in 1996!<br />Ertz
  had dated this painting to 1600 but whomever made it, it is more connected to Brueghel's
  somewhat later works. A very localized, domestic view.<br />In Ertz's catalogue
  of Jan the Younger he has, as #45, a reduced copy in Munich, Alte Pinakothek, inv.
  #1898 (copper, 21 x 29), signed and dated 1603 (a date that he notes must be wrong).
  </p><p>Later copy by follower in French private collection, copper, 19 x 23.  Possibly
  autograph variant signed and dated 1612!--see Ertz #258.   </p><p>From RKD photo
  if this is JB it's not one of his better efforts, the faces of figures have essentially
  no definition at all.  Conclusion:  there may have been a composition like this
  by JB some time around 1605, but this isn't it.</p><p>Here is a weird thing I notice
  on color repro in RKD voorordening.  The sailboat coming up at far right has a picture
  on its sail and it looks to me like a madonna and child in a sort of mandorla.  How
  likely is this?</p>"
