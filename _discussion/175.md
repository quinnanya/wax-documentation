comment: "<p>There is a related drawing by Van Balen in Antwerp, Stedelijk Prentenkabinet
  #537, dated 1605, although the drawing is larger than this painting. I believe that
  the composition derives from Rottenhammer. The Austin DIana and Callisto derives
  from this drawing too, but the subject of the drawing is actually Diana and Actaeon.</p>"
