comment: '<p>The idea of Coninxloo as a "collaborator" on a landscape with Jan Brueghel
  seems impossible to me. This is just waffling about attribution. </p><p>There is
  a missunderstanding: Ertz regards the staffage (the stag, the bird ...) as work
  of Jan Brueghel, not the landscape. This work with the pendant belongs to the Genre
  of "Staffage in Landscape". The attribution of the staffage to Jan Brueghel is,
  of course, questionable too.</p>'
