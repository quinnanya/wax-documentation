comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Possibly a copy after a drawing attributed to
  Matthijs or Paul Bril in the Albertina, Vienna; another version is at Chatsworth.
  Could be related to one of the prints by Aegidius Sadeler from the series ''Vestigi
  della Antichita di Roma'' dated 1606 (Hollstein 151-201; wanting in BM)."</p>'
