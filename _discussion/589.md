comment: "<p>I feel that this picture has many odd problems, like this suit of armor
  that's just too small in foreground (Jan would never do that). There are other scale
  problems here. It's a complicated and interesting painting and I wonder if it could
  be Jan the Younger working with Van Balen, or Jan's studio if the date of 1623 is
  genuine.<br />Very wooden copy on panel, 74.5 x 127, sold Paris (Hotel George V,
  9 April 1990 #32) as Jan the Younger, illustrated in Ertz 2008-10 p. 1073 with a
  different auction house.</p>"
