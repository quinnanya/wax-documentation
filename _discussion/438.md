comment: "<p>This work does not appear in the 1979 Ertz catalogue nor the Honig Database.
  It seems from photographs to be of poor quality and I would be inclined not to accept
  it. However, this is the best of all the versions of this composition. Besides the
  version accepted by Ertz 2008-10 as catalogue #246b, those are:</p><ul><li>painting
  with Nystad, The Hague, April 1970 (no info on size or support)</li><li>Painting
  sold Gasch, Dresden, April 29, 1912 #34; panel, 15 x 12</li><li>Weak variant in
  Vienna, Galerie Sanct Lucas, 1979/80; panel, 25 x 19; provenance to Imperial collection
  & Kunsthistorisch Museum Vienna, whence sold 1933.</li></ul>"
