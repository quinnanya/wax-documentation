comment: '<p>Although Ertz 2008-10 lists this as still in Prague, it is not in their
  2000 collection catalogue. A painting by Brueghel of the same subject with inventory
  #VO 1174, cat. #II/9, is listed among the works restituted or sold from the gallery''s
  collections: Prague 2000, p. 411.</p><p>Bits of this composition reappear in a "way
  to market" scene sold London (Christie''s May 14, 1965 lot #84).  Another copy (less
  good) in Ertz 2008-10, cat. #312, on panel, 23 x 35.5.  This could be a studio piece.  Ertz,
  p.650, tries to call it a collaboration between Jan the Elder and Jan the Younger
  produced after 1620, which makes no sense at all.  It is an absolutely exact replica
  of the present painting (240, in Prague) whereas the other better copy (Ertz 243)
  is a variant.  It repeats the central crowd of figures, as if there was a pattern
  drawing for this cluster, but completely alters the landscape and the figures outside
  that main cluster.  This is a perfect example of how the workshop must have operated
  and would be worth using in that context.<br />This work is similar to the Daniel
  at Milan in the range of peculiarly expressive faces--a real high point of Jan''s
  caricatural style.</p><p>Note that there is also a drawing of this subject in Stockholm
  that was in Essen show, but it seems quite independent of any of these paintings,
  which is curious.</p>'
