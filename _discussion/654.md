comment: '<p>Ertz (2008-10) speculates that this painting of ''''Allegory of Air''''
  is part of a series of the elements which Jan Brueghel painted between 1601-1611.  See
  Also:</p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-fire-venus-in-the-forge-of-vulcan-london">Allegory
  of Fire: Venus in the Forge of Vulcan (London)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-water-germany">Allegory
  of Water (Germany)</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/allegory-of-earth-paris">Allegory
  of Earth (Paris)</a></li></ul><p>The backside of the painting contains the inv.
  #286, from the Angela Burdett-Coutts collection.<br />The copper plate is also marked
  with the brand of Pieter Stas.<br />There is just one copy of this particular version
  of Air (and not the rest of the series, only Air). It is cataloged as ERtz, Jan
  Brueghel the Younger, cat. #200. I would accept that attribution, it makes sense:
  the copy is good enough to be by a decent painter, too independent to be a workshop
  copy but dependent enough to be the product of somebody without their own imagination.  Ertz
  also suggests a date of ca.1628 for the copy based on Jan the Younger''s diary which
  is perfectly possible as well.<br />For further information see the <a href="https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/16404">Rijksbureau
  voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie website on this painting</a></p>'
