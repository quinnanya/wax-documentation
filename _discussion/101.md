comment: "<p>Technical examination of this painting revealed no underdrawing but a
  rough indication of composition using green paint on a light grey ground. Wallart
  in Amsterdam 1999, p. 46<br />Although the Rijksmuseum website now dates this work
  to 1625-30, after Jan's death, their own technical team had proved pretty conclusively
  that the copper plate, at least, dates from ca. 1602. Of course it could have been
  sitting around Jan's workshop for 25 years but that seems unlikely.</p>"
