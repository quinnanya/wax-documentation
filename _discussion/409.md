comment: "<p>Spatial problems and overall quality here suggest that this was a studio
  work, though it is stronger than the many, many works that seem to have taken off
  from it. Many are attributed by Ertz to Jan the Younger (see Ertz 1984, #s 90-96).
  One is in Ertz 2008-10, cat. #193 as Jan the Elder. We do know that Jan the Younger
  produced paradise landscapes after his father's death. In fact some were left unfinished
  in the studio. Other versions not in Ertz 1984 include a painting in Stourhead House,
  Wiltshire (panel, 55 x 85) -- wiki page; one with Spark, New York, 1957 (65 x 92)
  -- wiki page; another collection Lazaro, Madrid (76 x 90) -- wiki page. Awful variant
  of these with dealer Abels, Cologne, 1939 (panel, 86 x 53). Somewhat better variant,
  related to these, in London, National Gallery, in 1929 #1881 (panel, 53 x 84) --
  wiki page. Photographs of several other bad versions at RKD without measurements
  or support. One odd enormous one (canvas, 114 x 165) sold Brussels, Fievez, May
  29/30, 1899 #17.</p>"
