comment: "<p>This is a variant of the Colonna version. However, when I compare the
  two main figures in this work to those in the Colonna work, these are just much
  less well done. Moreover, this entire painting is spatially and conceptually inferior,
  confused and incoherent. And yet -- this is an independent composition, not just
  a copy by any means; so if Jan didn't do it, who did? Surely he did not have a studio
  in Rome that was putting together works in this way. So how to explain it?</p><p>This
  painting bridges the gap between the Colonna picture and the rest of the Aeneas
  and Sibyl pictures because it's starting to have some nude figures (specific ones
  that are repeated in other Aeneas scenes) but it also has the torture wheel and
  other Boschian stuff. When Lilian had this picture he also had, as a pendant to
  this, an Aeneas Saving Anchises which was dated 1593 (a date that I doubt). There
  is no reason that they must have been pendants originally: the two could have been
  brought together at any time, since almost all of Jan's works from this period are
  on same-sized copper plates. No Roman patron is recorded as owning both of Brueghel's
  subjects from the Aeneid, although that would have been perfectly logical .</p>"
