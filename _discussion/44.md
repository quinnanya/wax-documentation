comment: "<p>A very good close variant sold Christie's London 10.vii.98 #8.  They
  attribute that one to Jan and Van Balen and date it, tentatively, 1617 (the 3d digit
  is illegible) but I think it's a Jan the Younger product and the date is 1627.  This
  copy is signed by Van Balen but not Brueghel, whereas the present work is signed
  by Jan Brueghel and not Van Balen.  This makes sense given relative statures within
  each pair of painters--but this is an interesting thing in and of itself, this taking
  turns signing.   The Art market version is oil on panel and 53.3 x 87.</p><p>Christie's
  version is an interesting picture, one of those surely attributable to Jan the Younger
  as a knock-off of something Dad had done just a few years before his death.  In
  Jan the Younger's journal in 1626, there is an entry that records a Forge of Vulcan
  executed with Van Balen, in which (he notes) Venus is pointing to the arms of the
  Duke of Savoy.   In the Christie's picture what Venus is pointing to in Vulcan's
  shield is the arms of the king of France (Vulcan is also pointing to that coat of
  arms):  the arms, 3 fleurs de lys, are encircled by 2 chains, one of which is attached
  to the badge of the order of St. Esprit.  The rest of the armor on the ground also
  displays this motif.   This must have been a commission.  Catalogue (Christie's)
  says that the armor seems to be Milanese and to date from the second half of the
  16th century.</p><p>This is the picture from which #276, that odd work in Munich,
  is an excerpt .  Another version of this composition is Ertz 1979, #277.   Another
  bad copy sold Christie's London 17.xii.99 #121 (panel, 46.5 x 84.5).  Another bad
  copy formerly art market somewhere in Holland (RKD photo); I think it's same as
  one sold Cologne (Lempertz 14.vi.41 #14, panel, 48 x 83).   Another copy sold Paris
  (Palais d'Orsay 24.ix.77 #28, panel, 53.5 x 88).  Awful copy sold Fievez 8.iv.30.<br
  />Note that there are some independent compositions that don't match any of these
  but are loosely based on them, like one in Kichinev, National Museum #4302 (panel,
  48.8 x 73.5) which has a most active Vulcan, and a full suit of armor standing tall
  at left.</p>"
