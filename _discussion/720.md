comment: "<p>Has been attributed to both Coninxloo and Jan Brueghel. My sense of this
  painting is that it is a wonderful and wildly inventive work but that the inventions
  are not characteristic of Jan, who tends to keep reusing good visual forms once
  he has invented them. Items like the Bacchic procession etc -- not Jan. It is however
  a very intriguing mixing of the classical and the Christian!</p>"
