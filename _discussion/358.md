comment: <p>According to Louisa Ruby, Jan Brueghel "used a similar bridge and the
  motif of St. Peter’s from his drawing <a href="/janbrueghel/view-of-the-city-of-rome-with-the-tiber-castel-sant-angelo-and-st-peters">View
  of the City of Rome with the Tiber, Castel Sant'Angelo and St. Peters</a> in numerous
  paintings, including Munich’s <a href="/janbrueghel/large-fish-market-with-self-portrait">Large
  Fish Market with Self Portrait</a> and the <a href="/janbrueghel/aeneas-carrying-anchises-from-the-burning-troy-munich">Aeneas
  Carrying Anchises from the Burning Troy (Munich)</a>"</p><p>According to Louisa
  Wood Ruby, this later painting includes Castel dell’Ovo, which seems to have been
  one of Jan Brueghel (I)'s preferred motifs, showing up in two of his drawings. His
  <a href="/janbrueghel/view-of-the-castel-dellovo">View of the Castel dell'Ovo</a>
  with its companion in the same collection <a href="/janbrueghel/view-of-naples-harbor">Harbor
  of Naples</a> has historically been considered evidence of Jan Brueghel (I)'s activity
  in Naples. His earliest paintings, <a href="/janbrueghel/christ-in-the-storm-christ-and-apostles-on-the-lake-of-tiberius-milan">Christ
  in the Storm (Christ and Apostles on the Lake of Tiberius) (Milan)</a> and the same
  subject in the collection Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid of 1596, <a href="/janbrueghel/christ-and-the-apostles-in-the-tempest-on-the-sea-of-galilee-madrid">Christ
  and the Apostles in the Tempest on the Sea of Galilee (Madrid)</a> as well as two
  magnificent later paintings in Munich, <a href="/janbrueghel/the-continence-of-scipio">The
  Continence of Scipio</a> of ca. 1603 and this one." </p><p>Wood Ruby also states
  that this painting reuses and enhances the same composition of <a href="/janbrueghel/harbor-with-a-fish-market">Harbor
  with a Fish Market</a>.</p>
