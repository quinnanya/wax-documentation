comment: "<p>Between the three inter-related pictures, the Munich one is of the highest
  quality, most densely and completely worked. The present work would be the next-most-carefully
  done. #485, in a private collection, is based on the same pattern but is less careful
  -- the descriptive upper layer of brushwork is not dense enough to cover the toned
  ground layer at various places in the garland.  All three works have the same garland,
  landscape, and animals but different arrangements of figures by the second artists.</p>"
