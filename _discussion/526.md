comment: '<p>British Museum website: "Popham describes this drawing as attributed
  to Ahasuerus van Londerseel in the manuscript catalogue of Sloane''s collection
  in 1845 but this attributions seems very unlikely. Popham attributes the work to
  ''some Dutch mannerist of about 1600, like Karel van Mander''.<br />This sheet shows
  some similarities with two study sheets containing figure studies attributed to
  Jan Brueghel the Elder in the Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth (inv.no.676) and
  in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin (inv.no.9621).<br />AVCLiterature: M. Winner,
  in ''Pieter Breughel d. Ã„. als Zeichner'', exh.cat. Kupferstichkabinett Berlin,
  1975, cat.nos.121 (Chatsworth) and 127 (Berlin, formerly attributed to Willem Buytewech)."</p>'
