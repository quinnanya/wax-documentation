comment: <p>In the opinion of Klaus Ertz, this painting is the original by Jan the
  Elder with Jan the Younger, and the other version is a variant of it. Bert Schepers
  feels that the present work is entirely by Jan the Elder. </p><p>The owner suggests
  that the presence of the Pan & Ceres painting suggests that the dating of this is
  slightly earlier, perhaps 1618. </p><p>A David Teniers "Banquet of Monkeys", painted
  much later (1660), derives from this Brueghel painting. Teniers was married to Anna
  Brueghel and must have owned or had access to this work. See Bert Scheppers in the
  Rubenianum Quarterly, 2014.</p>
