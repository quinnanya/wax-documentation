  motif of St. Peter’s from his drawing <a href="/janbrueghel/large-fish-market-with-self-portrait">Large
  Fish Market with Self Portrait</a> and the <a href="/janbrueghel/view-of-the-city-of-rome-with-the-tiber-castel-sant-angelo-and-st-peters">View
  of the City of Rome with the Tiber, Castel Sant'Angelo and St. Peters</a> in numerous
  paintings, including Munich’s <a href="/janbrueghel/large-fish-market-with-self-portrait">Large
  Fish Market with Self Portrait</a> and the <a href="/janbrueghel/aeneas-carrying-anchises-from-the-burning-troy-munich">Aeneas
  Carrying Anchises from the Burning Troy (Munich)</a>"</p>
