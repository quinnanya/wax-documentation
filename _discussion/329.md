comment: '<p>There are many variants of this painting of Mariemont Castle (Ertz 1979,
  Diaz Padron 1992). Ertz implies that this version in Richmond is the prime (Ertz
  1979, p. 177). See for example: </p><ul><li><a href="/janbrueghel/archduke-albert-before-mariemont-castle-germany">Archduke
  Albert before Mariemont Castle, Germany</a> </li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/landscape-with-mariemont-castle">Landscape
  with Mariemont Castle</a></li><li><a href="/janbrueghel/the-archdukes-and-company-before-mariemont-castle">The
  Archdukes and Company before Mariemont Castle</a></li></ul>'
