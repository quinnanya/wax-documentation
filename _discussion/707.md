comment: '<p>This work might be the Orpheus owned by Brueghel''s key patron, Francesco
  Maria del Monte, listed in his inventory as a "Fable of Eurydice"; while there are
  several other versions of the same subject also by Jan, the present work was already
  in Florence in 1704, and the Brueghels from major 16th-century Italian collections
  have tended to stay in Italy. The two other versions are: an exact copy of the same
  size, on copper, that was sold in London (Christies, April 22 1988 #53, signed and
  illegibly dated) and a more interesting variant also of the same size on copper
  that was sold in Paris (Robert Lebel, 1977), signed and dated 1594. Although the
  latter is not in Ertz 2008-10, it is probably autograph. These four interconnected
  works of 1594 suggest that by this time Jan had a market for his works in Rome that
  extended beyond his major patrons. </p><p>The present work is apparently not in
  very good condition, with some surface abrasion.</p>'
