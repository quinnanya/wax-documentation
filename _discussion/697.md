comment: "<p>Mark of Hans Goyvaerts, a contemporary art dealer in Antwerp, on back
  of plate.<br />One gravestone bears the date 1603 but Martin says that one of other
  gravestones might have been dated 1607.  He says this work is probably from before
  1610, certainly earlier than Ertz's suggested date of 1615 (I totally agree on that)
  but that 1603 (RKD date) is just the terminus post quem.  This is probably an early
  work by Steenwyck the Younger, and is related (said Jantzen) to works by his father.
  \ Steenwijck never enrolled in the Antwerp guild, which is really strange and Martin
  suggests indicates that he did not work there for a very long time.  It is, says
  Martin, possible that he finished this painting a while before JB added the figures,
  because they do relate closely to the ones in the 1615 picture.  Martin suggests
  that Jan bought the picture from Goyvaerts and then added the figures, which is
  a neat idea although just speculative.<br />There are many pentimenti visible in
  architecture, lowering arches, changing vaulting; there is a lot of underdrawing,
  some of which was ruled.</p>"
