comment: "<p>For the narrative of Alexander and Darius at Issus see Arrian, Anabasis
  Alexandri, trans. E. Iliff Robson. Loeb Classical Library. (London: Heinemann/ New
  York, Putnam & Sons, 1929), II:iii-xii; Quintus Curtius Rufus, History of Alexander
  I: Books I - V, trans. J.C. Rolfe. Loeb Classical Library. (Cambridge: Harvard University
  Press/ London: William Heinemann, 1962), Book III. Brueghel follows Quintus Curtius's
  account: Arrian describes Darius as fleeing in his golden chariot, as we see in
  Altdorfer's famous picture of this subject, but Quintus Curtius says that he left
  his chariot when the horses panicked, and instead fled on horseback and this is
  exactly what Brueghel shows.</p>"
