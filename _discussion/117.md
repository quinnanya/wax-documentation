comment: "<p>Drawing closely related to the present painting: Landscape with Windmills
  (19.7 x 30.9), New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Inv. #42 186. Ertz is not sure
  whether the drawing is a study for or a copy after the painting; it is certainly
  not “followed” in any other version. In general, in fact, the group of pictures
  is an excellent example of how drawings or sketches of motifs–the windmill, a house,
  individual figures and groups of figures, horses, and carts–were shuffled and combined,
  reversed and reduced and expanded, to produce new variants at different scales and
  on different supports.</p>"
