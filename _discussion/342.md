comment: "<p>The following information is from Pietrogiovanna 1987 and her sources.<br
  />Formerly attributed to Bril but museum now gives it to Jan Brueghel. In the British
  Museum in London there is a drawing attributed to Coninxloo that exactly reproduces
  this landscape but without the figures. This drawing was published as a Coninxloo
  by W. Wegner in Oud Holland 82, 203-224. It is slightly larger than this painting,
  20 x 31 cm. There are actually drawings related to this London drawing, one of which
  states in an inscription that the artist copied it from a Brueghel painting which
  had in turn been based on the Coninxloo drawing.<br />This painting seems therefore
  to confirm that Brueghel did stop in Frankenthal on his way to Italy. This probably
  happened around 1589. Pietrogiovanna suggests however that the painting dates from
  around 1594.</p>"
